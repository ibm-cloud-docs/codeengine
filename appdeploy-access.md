# Accessing your app
{: #access-service}

After your app deploys, you can access it through a URL.
{: shortdesc}

From the console, your application URL is available from the components page and on the application details page.

From the CLI, run the [**`ibmcloud ce app get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-get) command to find the URL of your app. To have the command output only the URL of the app, specify the `--output url` option with the **`app get`** command. 

## Access details about your app 
{: #access-app-details}

Find details about your app from the console or with the CLI.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} has quotas for apps and revisions of the apps within a project and app limits, such as memory and CPU. For more information about {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} limits, see [Limits and quotas for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-limits).

### Accessing app details from the console
{: #access-appdetails-ui}

Details about your app are available in the console from the app page by clicking the name of your app from the list of applications within your project. You can view information about the running instances of your application and its revisions, configuration details, and endpoint settings of the app. 

### Accessing app details with the CLI
{: #access-appdetails-cli}

To view details of your app with the CLI, use the **`app get`** command. For a complete listing of options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce app get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-get) command. 
{: shortdesc}

For example, the following **`app get`** command displays details about the `myapp` app.

```txt
ibmcloud ce app get --name myapp
```
{: pre}

## Application status
{: #app-status}

The following table shows the possible status that your application might have.

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ------------|
| Deploying | The application is deploying. Deployment time includes the time before the app is scheduled as well as time to download images over the network, which can take a while. |
| Ready | The application is deployed and ready to use. |
| Ready (with warnings) | The deployment of a new application revision failed, but the original deployment is available. |
| Failed | The application deployment terminated, and at least one instance terminated in failure. The instance either exited with nonzero status or was terminated by the system.
| Unknown | For some reason, the state of the application cannot not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host. |
