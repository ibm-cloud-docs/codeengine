# Why can't I see Connector logs?
{: #ts-connector-delete-apikey}


When you view logs for your Connector agents, you find an error similar to the following example.
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh
Failed to get configuration from API /v1/connectors/U2F0ZWxsaXRlQ29ubmVjdG9yOiJjaTExMGxpdzFwazluMGdybXUyMCI, region us-east, code: 401. IAM Error: "status code: 400. Provided API key could not be found.", API Error: "null"
```
{: screen}

If your API key is deleted while a Connector agent is running, the change is detected by the Connector agent after about 45 minutes. Without a valid API key, the Connector agent closes the tunnel. As a result, any application that uses an endpoint receives a communication error.
{: tsCauses}

You must update your API key and restart the Connector agent before you can use the tunnel or endpoints again.
{: tsResolve}
