# {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver
{: #storage-ibm-vpc-block-csi-driver}

The {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} Container Storage Interface (CSI) [Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ibm-vpc-block-csi-driver){: external} in {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong}} allows you to manage the lifecycle of your IBM VPC Block Data volumes.

The template is currently in beta. Do not use it for production workloads. 
{: beta}


Before you can deploy storage templates to clusters in your location, make sure you set up {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config by selecting the **Enable cluster admin access for Satellite Config** option in the console or including the `--enable-config-admin` option when you create your cluster.
{: important}

You cannot scope {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage service to resource groups. However, if you are scoping other resources such as location and cluster to resource groups, you need to add {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reader and link administrator role for all resources in the account.
{: note}

## Prerequisites for {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}}
{: #sat-storage-vpc-csi-prereq}

1. [Create a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations).

1. [Create an API key for access to your clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys){: external}

## Deploying an app that uses {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}}
{: #sat-storage-vpc-deploy-app}


You can use the `ibm-vpc-block-csi-driver` to create PVCs that you can use in your cluster workloads.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a PVC that references a VPC storage class that you created earlier.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: my-pvc
    spec:
      storageClassName: ibmc-vpc-block-5iops-tier
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi

    ```
    {: codeblock}
        
1. Create the PVC in your cluster. 

    ```sh
    oc apply -f pvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Create a YAML configuration file for a pod that mounts the PVC that you created. 

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: my-deployment
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels: 
        app: my-app
      template:
        metadata:
        labels:
            app: my-app
        spec:
        containers:
        - name: my-container
            image: ngnix
        volumeMounts:
            name: my-volume
            mountPath: /mount-path
        volumes:
            name: my-volume
            persistentVolumeClaim: null
            claimName: my-pvc
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Create the pod in your cluster.

    ```sh
    oc apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that the pod is deployed. Note that it might take a few minutes for your app to get into a `Running` state.

    ```sh
    oc get pods
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    ```sh
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    my-deployment                       1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Verify that the app can write to your block storage volume by logging in to your pod.

    ```sh
    oc exec my-deployment
    ```
    {: pre}

1. View the contents of the `outfile` file to confirm that your app can write data to your persistent storage.

    ```sh
    cat /
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    
    ```sh
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Exit the pod.

    ```sh
    exit
    ```
    {: pre}

## Removing {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} storage from your apps

        {: pre}

1. Delete the PVC.

    ```sh
    oc delete pvc <pvc_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that your PV is automatically removed.

    ```sh
    oc get pv
    ```
    {: pre}

## Removing the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} storage configuration from your cluster
{: #vpc-csi-template-rm}

If you no longer plan on using your {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} in your cluster, you can use the CLI unassign your cluster from the storage configuration.
{: shortdesc}

Note that if you remove the storage configuration, the driver is then uninstalled from all assigned clusters. Your PVCs, PVs, and data are not removed. However, you might not be able to access your data until you re-install the driver in your cluster again.
{: important}

    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment ls (--cluster CLUSTER | --config CONFIG | --location LOCATION | --service-cluster-id CLUSTER)
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Remove the assignment. After the assignment is removed, the driver pods and storage classes are removed from all clusters that were part of the storage assignment.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment rm --assignment <assignment_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Verify that the driver is removed from your cluster.

    1. List of the storage classes in your cluster and verify that the storage classes are removed.
    
        ```sh
        oc get sc
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. List the pods in the `kube-system` namespace and verify that the storage driver pods are removed.
    
        ```sh
        oc get pods -n kube-system | grep vpc
        ```
        {: pre}

4. Optional: Remove the storage configuration.
