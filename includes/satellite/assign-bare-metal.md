# Attaching bare metal hosts to a location
{: #assign-bare-metal}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="satellite"}
{: toc-completion-time="2hr"}

You can attach bare metal hosts to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location. After your hosts are attached, you can [set up  {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} virtualization](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-virtualization-location) in your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location. By using virtualization, you can provision Windows or other virtual machines on your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} in a managed {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} space. 
{: shortdesc}

Supported host operating systems
:   Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS)

The following steps use {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_long}} for Classic. However, you can adapt these steps for your own bare metal servers.
{: note}

## Prerequisites
{: #assign-bare-metal-prereq}

- Create a RHCOS-enabled location. To check whether your location is RHCOS-enabled, see [Is my location enabled for Red Hat CoreOS?](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations#verify-coreos-location) If your location is not enabled, [create a new one with RHCOS](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations).
- Attach hosts to your location and set up your [location control plane](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-setup-control-plane).
- Find and record your bare metal host name. For this {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}, this information is found in the **Name** field on the **Overview** page for your specific {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}.
- Find your bare metal server network information. For this {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}, this information is found in the **Network details** section on the **Overview** page. Record the CIDR and gateway information for the public and private interfaces for your system.
- Create or identify an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket to store your ignition file.
- Create or identify a cluster within the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location that runs a supported operating system; for example, this tutorial uses a {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster that is running 4.11.


In addition, the {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} used in this example required the following prerequisites.

- If you plan to have multiple VLANs for your cluster, multiple subnets on the same VLAN, or are planning for a multizone classic cluster, [enable VRF in your account](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint).
- [Create two VLAN pairs](/docs/cli?topic=cli-manage-classic-vlans#sl_vlan_create) (public and private) in the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center pod for each zone for your bare metal host.
- Later in this tutorial, you deploy [OpenShift Data Foundation for local disks](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-local&interface=ui). This solution requires additional storage devices on the worker nodes. 

## {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}} requirements
{: #setup-bare-metal}

To attach a bare metal host, your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}} must meet the following requirements. 

- Must support virtualization technology.
    - For Intel CPUs, support for virtualization is referred to as `Intel VT` or `VT-x`.
    - For AMD CPUs, support for virtualization is referred to as `AMD Virtualization` or `AMD-V`.
- Must have a minimum of 8 cores and 32 GB RAM, plus any additional cores that you need for your vCPU overhead. For more information, see [CPU overhead](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/virt/install/preparing-cluster-for-virt.html#CPU-overhead_preparing-cluster-for-virt){: external} in the {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} docs.
- Must include enough memory for your workload needs. For example: `360 MiB + (1.002 * requested memory) + 146 MiB + 8 MiB * (number of vCPUs) + 16 MiB * (number of graphics devices)`. For more information, see [Memory overhead](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/virt/install/preparing-cluster-for-virt.html#memory-overhead_preparing-cluster-for-virt){: external} in the {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} docs.
- No operating system installed. The Red Hat CoreOS operating system is installed later in this process.
- If you want to use OpenShift Data Foundation as your storage solution, add 2 storage disks to each of your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} when you provision them.

If your servers do not meet these requirements, you can [create a {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-ordering-baremetal-server). For a list of bare metal options, see [Available options for a bare metal server](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-about-bm#options-for-bare-metal-servers).
{: tip}


## Booting up your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}
{: #boot-bare-metal}
{: step}

For this specific {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}, you must use a browser that supports Java for classic. You can use the Safari browser on your local system or download a Java version that supports the `javaws` command.
{: note}

1. [Download a Red Hat CoreOS ISO](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/dependencies/rhcos/){: external}. Find the corresponding ISO version that matches the {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} version that you want to use. You can download any image that matches your minor version. For example, if you want to use version 4.11, [download a version of RHCOS for 4.11](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/dependencies/rhcos/4.11/){: external} like `rhcos-4.11.9-x86_64-live.x86_64.iso`.
1. Log in to your VPN to access to your host network. For more information, see [VPN access on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/products/vpn-access){: external}.
1. From the [Device list in the console](https://cloud.ibm.com/gen1/infrastructure/devices){: external}, select your bare metal server.
1. From the **Overview** page, note the networking values for your server. Find and verify the  CIDR and gateway information.
1. Click **Remote management** and make note of the `User` and `Password` in the **Management details** section. You use this username and password in later steps.
1. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions icon") > **KVM Console** to open your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}} console. Your browser might display a warning of an insecure self-signed certificate. Add the certificate to your browser truststore as a trusted CA certificate to continue.
1. Log in to your server with the `User` and `Password` that you retrieved earlier.
1. On the **System** tab, in the **Remote console preview**, click **Settings**.
1. Select **Java** to change the interface to use Java instead of HTML5.
1. Click the console preview to download a `launch.jnlp` file.
1. Open a terminal window and run the `.jnlp` file that you downloaded earlier with the `javaws <path_to_.jnlp>` command. Note that you might be prompted to update Java. If so, follow the prompts to update Java, and then retry the command. If you are prompted to allow input monitoring for the Terminal app or if the Java console window crashes, you must update your system preference setting for Input monitoring. You can update this setting by going to **System preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Input monitoring**. Then, relaunch the Java console with the `javaws <path_to_.jnlp>` command.
1. After the console loads, select **Virtual Media > Virtual Storage**. 
1. In the **Logical Drive Type** section, select **ISO File**.
1. Click **Open Image** and select the RHCOS ISO file that you downloaded.
1. Click **Plug in**.
1. Enter `exit` to access the BIOS login prompt.
1. Enter your Softlayer password at the BIOS prompt. 
1. On the **Advanced** tab, look for virtualization settings and enable them. 
    1. Select **CPU Configuration**.
    2. Look for `VTD` or `Intel Virtualization Technology` and make sure to enable it. For Intel CPUs, support is referred to as `Intel VT` or `VT-x`. For AMD CPUs, supported is referred to as `AMD Virtualization` or `AMD-V`. For more information, consult your hardware manufacturer documentation.
    3. Enable `VTD` if not enabled. For more information, consult your hardware provider documentation.
1. Configure the boot order. For example, to install this {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}, you can use a virtual ISO file. Your specific case might use a different external boot device.
    1. Select **Boot**.
    2. Select the option to Boot from Virtual ISO. 
    3. Ensure that `Hard Drive` is also an option in boot order.
1. Save your choices and exit. For example, for this {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}, click **Save and Exit**.
1. Save your changes and start the installation process. For example, for this {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}, click **Save Changes and Reset**.

When you save and exit, RHCOS begins installing. The next time that your system reboots, it boots RHCOS into memory. 

Proceed with the following sections immediately to prevent memory overwriting and corruption.
{: important}

## Setting up public networking
{: #public-network-bare-metal}
{: step}

You must set up a public network connection for your bare metal machine to download your host attach script (RHCOS ignition file). Identify your private and public interfaces. RHCOS translates network interface names to `eno` or `ens`. For this {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}, the public interface is `eth1` and the private interface is `eth0`.

After RHCOS is booted into memory, the `core@localhost` prompt is available. Follow these steps to set up your network connectivity for your bare metal server.

1. At the `core@localhost` prompt, run `ifconfig` to determine which interface is your public interface. Depending on the flavor of the bare-metal, the setup of the wired connections might be different. In this set up, the public interfaces were wired connections 3 and 5 and the private interfaces were wired connections 2 and 4. You can find this information in the output of the **`ifconfig`** command.
1. At the `core@localhost` prompt, enter `sudo nmtui`.
1. Click **Edit a Connection**. 
1. For each wired connection that you want to activate, click **IPv4 Configuration > Manual**.
1. Select **Show**.
1. Enter your CIDR for **Addresses**. The CIDR is the IP address and the subnet mask for that subnet.
1. Enter your gateway for **Gateway**.
1. Add DNS server information. For example, for this {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}, these values are `8.8.8.8` and `4.4.4.4` for public interfaces; and `10.0.80.11` and `10.0.80.12` for private interfaces.
1. Repeat these steps for each of the wired connections that you want to activate.
1. When you are finished, select **OK**, **Quit**.
1. Test that you have connectivity by pinging your server network. For example, to test the public network for this specific {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}}, `ping 8.8.8.8`.


## Configuring your ignition file
{: #config-ignition}
{: step}

Complete the following steps to configure your ignition file. The ignition file is used to attach your bare metal server as a host in your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location.

You must configure a separate ignition file for each bare metal host that you are attaching to the location.
{: note}

1. [Download the host attach script for your location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-attach-download){: external}. Make sure to specify `RHCOS` for the host operating system.
1. Get the host name for your bare metal system; for example, `mybaremetalserver`.
1. Convert your host name to `base64` by running the following command, substituting `<hostname>` with your bare metal server host name:
    ```sh
    echo <hostname> | base64
    ```
    {: pre}

1.  Open your ignition file and add the host name information to the `"storage":{"files":[` section. Replace `<hostname>` with the base64 encoded output from the previous step.

    ```sh
      {"overwrite": true,"path": "/etc/hostname","mode": 600,"contents": {"source": "data:text/plain;base64,<hostname>"},},],}
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    
    The first block of the ignition file with the host name `mybaremetalserver` is shown in the following example:
    
    ```sh
    {"ignition":{"version":"3.1.0"},"passwd":{"users":[{"name":"core","sshAuthorizedKeys":[""]}]},"storage":{"files":[{"overwrite": true,"path": "/etc/hostname","mode": 600,"contents": {"source": "data:text/plain;base64,bXliYXJlbWV0YWxzZXJ2ZXIK"}},{"overwrite":true,"path":"/usr/local/bin/ibm-host-attach.sh","contents":{"source":"data:text/plain;base64,
    ...
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Convert your private networking information to `base64` by running the following command. Replace `<private_interface>` with the name of your private interface name, for example, `en01`. Replace `<privateIPCIDR>` and `<gateway>` with your private IP CIDR and gateway. These values are what you used to set up your connection in the previous section.

    ```sh
    echo '[connection]
    id=<private-interface-name>
    type=ethernet
    interface-name=<private-interface-name>
    [ipv4]
    never-default=true
    address1=<private-ip-cidr>,<gateway> 
    dns=10.0.80.11;10.0.80.12;
    route1=10.0.0.0/8,<gateway>
    route2=161.26.0.0/16,<gateway>
    route3=166.8.0.0/14,<gateway>
    dns-search=
    may-fail=false
    method=manual' | base64
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    
    For example:
    
      ```sh
      echo '[connection]
      id=eno1
      type=ethernet
      interface-name=eno1
      [ipv4]
      never-default=true
      address1=10.190.196.9/26,10.190.196.129
      dns=10.0.80.11;10.0.80.12;
      route1=10.0.0.0/8,10.190.96.129
      route2=161.26.0.0/16,10.190.96.129
      route3=166.8.0.0/14,10.190.96.129
      dns-search=
      may-fail=false
      method=manual' | base64
      ```
      {: screen}

1. Add these connection details to your ignition file. Replace `<private_interface>` with your private interface name, for example `eno1`. Replace `<private_connection_details>` with the base64 encoded output from the previous step.

    ```sh
      {"overwrite": true,"path": "/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<private_interface>.nmconnection","mode": 256,"contents": {"source": "data:text/plain;base64,<private_connection_details>"}}
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    
    For example, to add the networking information from the previous step, enter the following code sample.
    
    ```sh
    { "overwrite": true,"path": "/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/en01.nmconnection","mode": 256,"contents": {     "source": "data:text/plain;base64,W2Nvbm5lY3Rpb25dCiAgICAgIGlkPWVubzEKICAgICAgdHlwZT1ldGhlcm5ldAogICAgICBpbnRlcmZhY2UtbmFtZT1lbm8xCiAgICAgIFtpcHY0XQogICAgICBuZXZlci1kZWZhdWx0PXRydWUKICAgICAgYWRkcmVzczE9MTAuMTkwLjE5Ni45LzI2LDEwLjE5MC4xOTYuMTI5CiAgICAgIGRucz0xMC4wLjgwLjExOzEwLjAuODAuMTI7CiAgICAgIHJvdXRlMT0xMC4wLjAuMC84LDEwLjE5MC45Ni4xMjkKICAgICAgcm91dGUyPTE2MS4yNi4wLjAvMTYsMTAuMTkwLjk2LjEyOQogICAgICByb3V0ZTM9MTY2LjguMC4wLzE0LDEwLjE5MC45Ni4xMjkKICAgICAgZG5zLXNlYXJjaD0KICAgICAgbWF5LWZhaWw9ZmFsc2UKICAgICAgbWV0aG9kPW1hbnVhbAo="}},
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Convert your public networking information to `base64` by running the following command. Replace `<public_interface>` with the name of your public interface name, for example, `eno2`.  Replace `<publicIPCIDR>` and `<gateway>` with your public IP CIDR and public IP gateway. These values are what you used to set up your connection in the previous section.

    ```sh
    echo '[connection]
    id=<public_interface>
    type=ethernet
    interface-name=<public_interface>
    [ipv4]
    address1=<publicIPCIDR>,<gateway>
    dns=8.8.8.8;4.4.4.4;
    dns-search=
    may-fail=false
    method=manual' |base64
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    
    
    Example command to base64 encode your public interface details.
    ```sh
    echo '[connection]
    id=eno2
    type=ethernet
    interface-name=eno2
    [ipv4]
    address1=52.117.108.24/28,52.117.108.17
    dns=8.8.8.8;4.4.4.4;
    dns-search=
    may-fail=false
    method=manual' |base64
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Add these connection details to your ignition file. Replace `<public_interface>` with your public interface name, for example `eno2`. Replace `<public_connection_details>` with the base64 encoded output from the previous step.

    ```sh
      {"path": "/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<public_interface>.nmconnection","mode": 256,"contents": {"source": "data:text/plain;base64,<public_connection_details>"}}
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    
    For example, to add the networking information from the previous step, enter the following code sample, immediately following the private interface code sample.
    
    ```sh
    {"path": "/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/en02.nmconnection","mode": 256,"contents": {"source": "data:text/plain;base64,W2Nvbm5lY3Rpb25dCiAgICBpZD1lbm8yCiAgICB0eXBlPWV0aGVybmV0CiAgICBpbnRlcmZhY2UtbmFtZT1lbm8yCiAgICBbaXB2NF0KICAgIGFkZHJlc3MxPTUyLjExNy4xMDguMjQvMjgsNTIuMTE3LjEwOC4xNwogICAgZG5zPTguOC44Ljg7NC40LjQuNDsKICAgIGRucy1zZWFyY2g9CiAgICBtYXktZmFpbD1mYWxzZQogICAgbWV0aG9kPW1hbnVhbAo="}},
    
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Save your ignition file. Your file must be flat and not contain any returns. The following example ignition file shows the additions that are made with the previous steps for `mybasemetalserver`.

    ```sh

1. Upload your ignition file to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket that you identified earlier. From your **Bucket** page in the console, click **Add object**. Drag your ignition file in the bucket. 
  
## Attaching your bare metal host to the location
{: #load-ignition-file-bare-metal}
{: step}


Download the ignition file to your bare metal host, then run it to attach the bare metal host to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location.


1. Run the following command to download the file from your bucket to your host machine. Replace `<bucketname>` with the name of your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket, `<cos_region>` with the region of your bucket (for example, `us.east`), and `<filename>` with the name of your ignition file that is in the bucket.

    You can run the `curl` command without creating a local file on the bare metal server to ensure your bare metal server can reach the bucket by removing `> ignition.ign` from the following example.
    {: tip}

    ```sh
    curl https://<bucketName>.s3.<cos_region>.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/<filename> > ignition.ign
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    For example:
    
    ```sh
    curl https://mybucket.s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/attachHostmysatloc.ign > ignition.ign
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Identify the disk that you want to install the CoreOS operating system to. To identify disks, run `lsblk`

    ```sh
    lsblk
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    The following example is possible output.
    
    ```sh
    NAME  MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
    loop0   7:0    0  15.5G  0 loop  /run/ephemeral
    loop1   7:1    0 979.1M  1 loop  /sysroot
    sda     8:0    0   1.8T  0 disk  
    sr0    11:0    1   1.1G  0 rom.  /run/media/iso  
    ```
    {: screen}
    
    From this output, choose to install on the `sda` disk. 

1. Run the following `install` command to start the ignition file. Replace `<diskName>` with the full path of the disk that you retrieved from `lsblk` and replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you downloaded from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}.

    ```sh
    sudo coreos-installer install <diskName> --ignition-file <filename>
