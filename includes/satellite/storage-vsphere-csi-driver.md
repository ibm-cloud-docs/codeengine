# VMware Block Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver
{: #storage-vsphere-csi-driver}

The VMware Container Storage Interface (CSI) [Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/vsphere-csi-driver/){: external} allows you to manage the lifecycle of your VMware Block Data volumes.

## Prerequisites
{: #prereq-vmware-csi}

Before you can create a VMware block storage configuration, you must satisfy the following prerequisites. 

1. Verify that you are running vSphere version 6.7U3 or later.
1. Verify that your virtual machine hardware version is version 15 or later.
1. Verify that master nodes can communicate with the vCenter management interface.
1. Disable Swap on all nodes.
1. Enable Disk UUID on all node virtual machines. 
1. Deploy vSAN in your vSphere environment. For more information, see the [vSAN documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSAN/index.html){: external}.

 
Before you can deploy storage templates to clusters in your location, make sure you set up {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config by selecting the **Enable cluster admin access for Satellite Config** option in the console or including the `--enable-config-admin` option when you create your cluster.
{: important}

You cannot scope {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage service to resource groups. However, if you are scoping other resources such as location and cluster to resource groups, you need to add {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reader and link administrator role for all resources in the account.
{: note}





## Creating and assigning a configuration in the console
{: #vsphere-csi-driver-config-create-console}
{: ui}


1. Review the [parameter reference](#vsphere-csi-driver-parameter-reference).


1. [From the Locations console](https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/locations){: external}, select the location where you want to create a storage configuration.
1. Select **Storage** > **Create storage configuration**
1. Enter a name for your configuration.
1. Select the **Storage type**.
1. Select the **Version** and click **Next**
1. If the **Storage type** that you selected accepts custom parameters, enter them on the **Parameters** tab.
1. If the **Storage type** that you selected requires secrets, enter them on the **Secrets** tab.
1. On the **Storage classes** tab, review the storage classes that are deployed by the configuration or create a custom storage class.
1. On the **Assign to service** tab, select the service that you want to assign your configuration to.
1. Click **Complete** to assign your storage configuration.

## Deploying an app that uses VMware
{: #sat-storage-vmware-deploy-app}

You can use the `vmware-csi-driver` to create PVCs that you can use in your cluster workloads.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a PVC that references the storage class that you created earlier.

    ```yaml
        kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        apiVersion: v1
        metadata:
            name: podpvc
        spec:
            accessModes:
             - ReadWriteOnce
            storageClassName: sat-vsphere-vsan-block-metro
            resources:
                requests:
                storage: 10Gi
    ```
    {: codeblock}
        
1. Create the PVC in your cluster. 

    ```sh
    oc apply -f podpvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Create a YAML configuration file for a pod that mounts the PVC that you created. 

    ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
        name: web-server
        spec:
        containers:
        - name: #web-server
            image: nginx
            command:
                - "/bin/sh"
                - "-c"
                - while true; do echo $(date) >> /mnt/vmwaredisk/outfile; sleep 1; done
            volumeMounts:
             mountPath:  /mnt/vmwaredisk
                name: mypvc
        volumes:
        - name: mypvc
            persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: podpvc
            readOnly: false

    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Create the pod in your cluster.

    ```sh
    oc apply -f mypvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that the pod is deployed. Note that it might take a few minutes for your app to get into a `Running` state.

    ```sh
    oc get pods
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    ```sh
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    my-pvc                              1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Verify that the app can write to your block storage volume by logging in to your pod.

    ```sh
    oc exec -it web-server /bin/bash
    ```
    {: pre}

1. View the contents of the `outfile` file to confirm that your app can write data to your persistent storage.

    ```sh
    cat outfile
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    
    ```sh
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Exit the pod.

    ```sh
    exit
    ```
    {: pre}
