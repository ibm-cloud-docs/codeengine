# Regions

Review the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} regions that you can choose from to manage your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location. The hosts that you want to attach to the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane must have a low latency connection of less than or equal to 200 milliseconds (`<= 200ms`) round trip time (RTT) to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region that your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location is managed from. As latency increases, you might see impacts to performance, including {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link throughput, {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service provisioning time, host failure recovery time, and in extreme cases, the availability of resources that run in the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane, such as {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster masters. For more information, see [Testing the latency between {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane hosts](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-latency-test#host-latency-mzr).

Red Hat CoreOS is available in all supported {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} locations and for {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} version 4.9 and later. Red Hat CoreOS hosts don't support all services. For more information, see [Supported {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled IBM Cloud services](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-managed-services).

`†` EU Cloud Certified Locations are managed from the Frankfurt region. To order these, ensure you choose `fra` as the value for the `--managed-from` option.

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} regions for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} FAQs
{: #understand-supported-regions}

Review some frequently asked questions about why and how you choose an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region to manage your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location.
{: shortdesc}

### Why is my location managed by an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region?
{: #supported-regions-why-location}

Running {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services on your own infrastructure requires a secure connection to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The connection is controlled, monitored, and managed by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to ensure that security and compliance standards for each of the services are met and to roll out updates to these services.

Every {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location is set up with a control plane that establishes the secure connection back to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The control plane consists of a highly available management plane that runs in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region that you choose. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} controls and manages this management plane.  The control plane nodes run on your own compute hosts that you attached to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location.

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} uses this connection to monitor your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location, automatically detect and resolve capacity issues, monitor malicious activity, and roll out updates to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that you run on your infrastructure.

For more information, see the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} architecture](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-service-architecture#architecture).

### What {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} multizone metro do I choose for my {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location?
{: #supported-regions-what-multizone-metro}

You can choose any of the supported {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region to manage your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location. The metro determines where the master of your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} control plane runs. For more information, see the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} architecture](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-service-architecture#architecture). To reduce latency between the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region and your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location, choose the region that is closest to where your physical compute infrastructure is.

### Can my hosts reside anywhere?
{: #supported-regions-limitations}

Because you bring your own compute host infrastructure to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location, you can choose to host this infrastructure anywhere you need it. Hosts can be in your own on-premises data center, public cloud providers, or edge computing devices if they meet the [minimum host requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-reqs) for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}.

### How can I deploy in an EU Cloud Certified Location?
{: #eu-certified}

EU Cloud Certified Locations are managed from the Frankfurt region. To order these types of locations, ensure you choose `fra` as the value for the `--managed-from` option.

Example command:

```sh
ibmcloud sat location create --name LOCATION_NAME --coreos-enabled --managed-from fra
```
{: pre}

or 

```sh
ibmcloud sat location create --name LOCATION_NAME --managed-from fra
```
{: pre}

### What about latency requirements?
{: #supported-regions-latency}

As you select your infrastructure provider, consider the following latency requirements. Environments that do not meet the latency requirements experience degraded performance.

Between {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and the location
:   The hosts that you want to attach to the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane must have a low latency connection of less than or equal to 200 milliseconds (`<= 200ms`) round trip time (RTT) to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region that your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location is managed from. As latency increases, you might see impacts to performance, including {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link throughput, {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service provisioning time, host failure recovery time, and in extreme cases, the availability of resources that run in the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane, such as {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster masters. For more information, see [Testing the latency between {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane hosts](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-latency-test#host-latency-mzr).

Between hosts in your location
:   Your host infrastructure setup must have a low latency connection of less than or equal to 100 milliseconds (`<= 100ms`) round trip time (RTT) between the hosts that are used for the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane worker nodes and the hosts that are used for other resources in the location, like clusters or [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-managed-services). For example, in cloud providers such as AWS, this setup typically means that all the hosts in the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location are from the same cloud region, like `us-east-1`. As latency increases, you might see impacts to performance, including provisioning and recovery times, reduced worker nodes in the cluster, {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service degradation, and in extreme cases, failures in your cluster applications.
