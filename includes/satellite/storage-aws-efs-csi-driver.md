# AWS EFS 
{: #storage-aws-efs-csi-driver}

Set up [Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/?id=docs_gateway){: external} for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} clusters by creating a storage configuration in your location. When you assign a storage configuration to your clusters, the storage drivers of the selected storage provider are installed in your cluster.
{: shortdesc}

To use AWS EFS storage for your apps, your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} hosts must reside in AWS. Only static provisioning is supported with this storage template. You must manually provision an [AWS EFS file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-two-create-efs-resources.html){: external} on AWS before you create your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage configuration. Make sure that the EFS device is in the same VPC and subnet that you used for your AWS hosts, and that your hosts and EFS device use the same security group.
{: important}

Before you can deploy storage templates to clusters in your location, make sure you set up {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config by selecting the **Enable cluster admin access for Satellite Config** option in the console or including the `--enable-config-admin` option when you create your cluster.
{: important}

You cannot scope {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage service to resource groups. However, if you are scoping other resources such as location and cluster to resource groups, you need to add {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reader and link administrator role for all resources in the account.
{: note}

## Prerequisites for using AWS EFS
{: #sat-storage-efs-prereqs}

To use the AWS EFS storage template, complete the following tasks:

1. [Create a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations).

1. [Create a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-satellite-clusters) that runs on compute hosts in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Make sure that you select the **Enable cluster admin access for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config** option when you create the cluster. If you don't enable Administrator (admin) access for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config when creating your cluster, you must re-create your cluster and enable admin access before you can deploy storage. For more information about how to add hosts from AWS to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location so that you can assign them to a cluster, see [Adding AWS hosts to {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-aws#aws-host-attach).
1. Manually provision an [AWS EFS file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-two-create-efs-resources.html){: external} in your AWS account. Make sure that the EFS device is in the same VPC and subnet that you used for your AWS hosts, and that your hosts and EFS device use the same security group.

    ```
    {: pre}
    
3. Complete the following steps to assign your storage configuration to your clusters.


## Deploying an app that uses AWS EFS storage
{: #sat-storage-efs-deploy}


You can use the `efs-csi-driver` to statically provision AWS EFS storage for the apps in your clusters.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin, make sure that you [created an AWS EFS instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-two-create-efs-resources.html){: external} in your AWS account.The EFS device must be in the same VPC and subnet that you used for your AWS hosts, and your hosts and EFS device must use the same security group.

1. From the [AWS EFS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/home){: external}, find the file system that you want to use for your apps and note the file system ID.

2. Create a persistent volume (PV) that references the file system ID of your AWS EFS instance.
    1. Create a YAML configuration file for your PV and enter the file system ID in the `csi.volumeHandle` field.
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolume
        metadata:
          name: efs
        spec:
          capacity:
          storage: 5Gi
          volumeMode: Filesystem
          accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
          persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
          storageClassName: # Enter the name of the custom storage class that you created earlier
          csi:
          driver: efs.csi.aws.com
          volumeHandle: <aws_efs_fileshare_ID>
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    2. Create the PV in your cluster.
        ```sh
        oc apply -f pv.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

    3. Verify that the PV is created. Note that the PV remains in an `Available` status as no matching PVC is found yet.
        ```sh
        oc get pv
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        NAME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS        CLAIM        STORAGECLASS           REASON   AGE
        efs    5Gi        RWO            Retain           Available                  sat-aws-file-gold               34m
        ```
        {: screen}

3. Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) that matches the PV that you created.
    1. Create a YAML configuration file for your PVC. In order for the PVC to match the PV, you must use the same values for the storage class and the size of the storage.
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        metadata:
          name: efs
        spec:
          accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
          storageClassName: # Enter the custom storage class that you created earlier.
          resources:
          requests:
            storage: 5Gi
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    2. Create the PVC in your cluster.
        ```sh
        oc apply -f pvc.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

    3. Verify that the PVC is created. Make sure that the PVC is in a `Bound` status and that the name of the PV that you created earlier is listed in the **VOLUME** column.
        ```sh
        oc get pvc
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        NAME      STATUS        VOLUME     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS        AGE
        efs       Bound         efs        5Gi        RWO            sat-aws-file-gold   36m
        ```
        {: screen}

4. Create a YAML configuration file for a pod that mounts the PVC that you created. The following example creates an `nginx` pod that writes the current date and time to a `test.txt` file on your AWS EFS volume mount path.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: app
    spec:
      containers:
       - name: app
      image: nginx
      command: ["/bin/sh"]
      args: ["-c", "while true; do echo $(date -u) >> /test/test.txt; sleep 5; done"]
      volumeMounts:
      - name: persistent-storage
        mountPath: /test
      volumes:
      - name: persistent-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: efs
    ```
    {: codeblock}

5. Create the pod in your cluster.
    ```sh
    oc apply -f pod.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Verify that the pod is deployed. Note that it might take a few minutes for your app to get into a `Running` state.
    ```sh
    oc get pods
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output
    ```sh
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    app                                 1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```
    {: screen}

7. Verify that the app can write to your AWS EFS instance.
    1. Log in to your pod.
        ```sh
        oc exec <app-pod-name> -it bash
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Display the contents of the `test.txt` file to confirm that your app can write data to your persistent storage.
        ```sh
        cat /test/test.txt
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:19 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:25 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:31 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:36 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:42 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:47 UTC 2021
        ```
        {: screen}

    3. Exit the pod.
        ```sh
        exit
        ```
        {: pre}

8. From the [AWS EFS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/home){: external}, find the file system that you used and verify that the file system grows in size.

## Removing AWS EFS storage from your apps
{: #aws-efs-rm}


If you no longer need your AWS EFS instance, you can remove your PVC, PV, and the AWS EFS instance in your AWS account.
{: shortdesc}

Removing your AWS EFS instance permanently removes all the data that is stored on this instance. This action cannot be undone. Make sure that you back up your data before you delete the AWS EFS instance.
{: important}

1. List your PVCs and note the name of the PVC and the corresponding PV that you want to remove.
    ```sh
    oc get pvc
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Remove any pods that mount the PVC.
    1. List all the pods that currently mount the PVC that you want to delete. If no pods are returned, you do not have any pods that currently use your PVC.
        ```sh
        oc get pods --all-namespaces -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName}{" "}{end}{end}' | grep "<pvc_name>"
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        app    sat-aws-block-bronze
        ```
        {: screen}

    2. Remove the pod that uses the PVC. If the pod is part of a deployment, remove the deployment.
        ```sh
        oc delete pod <pod_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

        ```sh
        oc delete deployment <deployment_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

    3. Verify that the pod or the deployment is removed.
        ```sh
        oc get pods

        {: pre}

        ```sh
        oc get deployments
        ```
        {: pre}

3. Delete the PVC. Because you statically provisioned the AWS EFS storage, deleting the PVC does not remove the PV or the AWS EFS instance in your AWS account.
    ```sh
    oc delete pvc <pvc_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Delete the corresponding PV.
    ```sh
    oc delete pv <pv_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

5. From the [AWS EFS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/home){: external}, select the file system that you want to delete and click **Delete**.
