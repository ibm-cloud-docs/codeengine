{: screen}  

Your Connector Agent Docker container was unable to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Connector servers, because of a firewall, gateway, or proxy configuration that is blocking public outbound access to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} in your environment.
{: tsCauses}

Make sure the the machine that is running the Connector Agent has outbound connectivity to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and can resolve those hostnames. For more information, see the network connectivity requirements documented in [Minimum requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-understand-connectors#min-requirements).
