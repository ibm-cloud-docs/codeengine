## Viewing events for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}
{: #at_ui}

Events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region that the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location location is managed from. {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} has only one instance per region, which you can use to view events for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services in that region. For more information, see [Navigating to the UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch).
{: shortdesc}


{{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) events are available in the **Frankfurt (eu-de)** region. To view these events, you must provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the **Frankfurt (eu-de)** region. Then navigate to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} UI.
