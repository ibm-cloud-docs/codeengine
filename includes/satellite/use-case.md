{: #use-case-manufacture}

These use cases are applicable to the manufacturing industry.
{: shortdesc}

### Internet of Things (IoT) service platform 
{: #use-case-manufacture1}

An IoT service platform can be delivered on cloud or on-premises to meet the user’s (manufacturing plants) requirements. The IoT service platform can be distributed, managed, and controlled remotely for users (manufacturing plants) that are restricted from connecting to and using cloud. 
{: shortdesc}

Pain points:
:   For plants with stringent security network requirements, it is impossible to deliver IoT services in the same way as cloud. For these plants, services must be built separately.

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enables:
:   IoT service platform that was previously only available on cloud to be deployed within the customer’s plant, benefiting from use of cloud-like services.

### Enable the digital transformation of on-premises legacy systems at steel mills and other manufacturing plants 
{: #use-case-manufacture2}

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enables legacy host systems at each site to run on digital transformation service platforms, built on containers through integration. Additionally, {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} drives digital transformation at the isolated sites that cannot take advantage of cloud and container technology.
{: shortdesc}

Pain points:
:   Systems with strict on-premises requirements, such as z/HOST and sensitive data, prevent the move to the cloud. Many applications cannot tolerate network latency. Lack of container skills in an on-premises environment hampers digital transformation of site applications. 

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enables:
:   A digital transformation service platform built on containers that was previously only available on cloud can now be deployed within the plant. It also enabled the delivery of cloud-like quality control, such as image analysis, and data lake related services at the plant.

### Establish a service platform for point of sale (POS) or multi function printer (MFP) systems 
{: #use-case-manufacture3}

When you provide platform-based management services and data services to store POS systems nationwide as well as MFP systems in corporate offices, it can be difficult to integrate with these customer systems. Using {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enables platform services to be delivered to a site that meets customer requirements. 
{: shortdesc}

Pain points:
:   It is hard to build a service platform that can provide a function for collecting the latest data and other added value to deliver services that leverage data from POS and MFP equipment.

### Accelerate the establishment of new global sites and plants 
{: #use-case-manufacture4}

When companies establish a new global site, production line management systems and Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems that are used in existing plants can be distributed from cloud. Because servers are needed only at the new site, you can accelerate the system build and operations, and address skill gaps and security concerns.
{: shortdesc}

Pain points:
:   With new global sites, a significant time is spent to build server environments for each site, deploying applications and developing an operations structure. Lack of skills due to inability to secure staff in the new region can delay go-live dates. The common application cannot be moved to the cloud due to latency and security issues. 

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enables: 
:   It helps eliminate issues, including skill shortage and acceleration of deployment and go-live when you deliver applications to various global sites. Applications can be deployed and run on-premises, addressing security and latency concerns. With unified management, the same applications can be easily rolled out and operated.

### Contain cost and speed for new services during development phase and move on-premises once established 
{: #use-case-manufacture5}

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enables applications to be deployed in accordance with the phase that the server or application is in. For example, platform applications can be easily deployed on-premises, following a growth in business or in response to heightened security risks. 
{: shortdesc}

Pain points:
:   Many businesses want to start small on cloud and move to on-premises after the business grows to a certain scale. They do not want to be locked into a single vendor, as cloud applications cannot be moved on-premises. They need the flexibility to deploy to distributed environments, including on-premises in response to the scale of business. 

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enables: 
: Applications that are initially developed and delivered on cloud can be moved as-is on-premises so that distributed deployment in accordance with the scale of business and acceleration in business speed and mitigation of various risks.

### Deploy applications on-premises, scale out to the cloud only during peak times
{: #use-case-manufacture6}

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enables applications to be deployed anywhere, on-premises or on cloud. This capability can be used to scale-out (autoscale) to the cloud during peak times such as new product releases to optimize cost.
{: shortdesc}

Pain points:
:   Clients prefer to run on-premises from cost reduction perspective and distribute resources to the cloud only during peak times. The application deployment experience is inconsistent between cloud and on-premises. Clients also want to use scalable containers on-premises.

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enables: 
:   It enables delivery of container platforms that support DevOps and can be distributed anywhere. Same applications can be instantly moved to the cloud only during peak times, optimizing costs.
