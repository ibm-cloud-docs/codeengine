## Capabilities
{: #capability-comparison}

Satellite Connector offers a lot of the same capabilities as Secure Gateway and some additional features which provide a more seamless integration into IBM Cloud.
  
The following table highlights how capabilities are provided in Secure Gateway and {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connector.


| Topic | Secure Gateway | {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connector | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public internet access | Cloud side of a destination is exposed on a public IP address. | Cloud side of an endpoint is exposed only to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private endpoint network so that it's reachable only from within {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. | {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connector Access Control List sets the access. |  
| Integrations | N/A | Integrated when you connect your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connector Agent location to Activity Tracker, LogDNA, and Sysdig. | The agent itself runs on a container platform that isn’t integrated into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} tools. For example,  Docker won’t send logs to logDNA.  |  
| Client access | Secure Gateway Client supports Windows, Linux, Mac, Node.js module, and container. | {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connector supports container.  |  |  
| Clients per instance | Limited to 4 client connections for high availability | For high availability support, use 3 clients. Up to 9 clients allowed to scale containers over time. |  |  
| Client requirements | See [Requirements to run the Client](/docs/SecureGateway?topic=SecureGateway-client-requirements). | - **Host type:** Most container hosts can run the client container image, including the Docker Community Edition.  \n - **Ports:** Only requires port 443 to be opened. | |  
| Encryption (TLS support) | TLS version supported is 1.2. Protocols supported are UDP, TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS. | TCP, TLS (version 1.3), HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP Tunnel. No UDP support. |  |  
| Authentication | Mutual authentication is supported. | Provided by the target and can be configured with mutual authentication on the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connector parts. |  |  
| Load balancing and high availability | Can connect multiple instances of the Secure Gateway Service client to your gateway to automatically use built-in connection load balancing and connection fail-over if a client instance goes down. | Can connect multiple Connector agents to your connector instance in Cloud to automatically use built-in load balancing and connection failover if an container goes down. |
