# {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connector FAQ
{: #connector-faq}

## Does {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connector support Cloud Endpoints?
{: #connector-faq-endpoints}

At this time, {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connector only supports On Location endpoints to access your resources on-prem from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
  
## How can I restrict access to my endpoints?
{: #connector-faq-restrict}

You can set up ACL rules to restrict access to your endpoints. When you create your link endpoint, select an existing ACL rule or create a new ACL rule to control which clients can access location endpoint resources. If no ACL rule is selected, any client that is connected to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network can use the endpoint to connect to the destination resource that runs in your location.
  
## I created an ACL for my Connector, why doesn't it take effect?
{: #connector-faq-acl-implementation}

Make sure you apply the ACL to the endpoint you want to use it against. 
  
## What IAM permissions do I need for Connectors?
{: #conector-faq-permissions}

To create a Connector, you need **Administrator** Platform role for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}. To connect an Agent to an existing Connector, you need **Viewer** Platform role or **Reader** Service role for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}.

## How many Connectors are supported per account per region?
{: #connector-faq-con-per-region}

You can have a maximum of 25 Connectors per account per region.

## How many endpoints are supported per Connector?
{: #connector-faq-endpoints-per-conn}

You can have a maximum of 25 endpoints per Connector.

## How many instances of Connector agent can I run?
{: #connector-faq-instance-limits}

As a best practice, run no more than 6 agents per Connector.

## Can I deploy {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Connectors within {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}?
{: #connector-ibm-cloud}

Connectors are generally not recommended for use within {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} except for specific use cases. Please contact your IBM account team if you believe you need this support for your solution.
