Your host doesn't meet the requirements or it needs to be rebooted.
{: tsCauses}

Follow these steps to resolve your issue.
{: tsResolve}

1. Verify that your host meets the requirements. For more information, see [Host network requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-reqs-host-network).

2. If your host meets the requirements, perform an `nslookup` on your location subdomain to retrieve the IP address of the host that is registered with this subdomain.  
 
3. Find the host in your infrastructure provider and reboot the host. 

4. If the reboot does not resolve the issue, replace the host.
    
5. If you are still unable to resolve the issue, [open a support case](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-get-help#help-support). In the support case description, include all debugging steps that you followed and the output from these steps.
