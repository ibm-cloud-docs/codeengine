# Checking your host setup
{: #host-network-check}

After you create hosts that meet the [system requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-reqs), [network requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-reqs-host-network), and the [outbound connectivity requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-reqs-host-network-outbound), you can verify your host setup by running the following `sat-host-check` script.

1. Log in to your host.
    ```sh
    ssh root@<IP_address>
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    1. For RHEL hosts, SSH as root.
        ```sh
        ssh root@<IP_address>
        ```
        {: pre}
        
    1. For RHCOS hosts, copy your public SSH key into your ignition script and log in as core.
        1. Download the host attach script and add your public SSH key.

            ```json
            {
              "ignition": {
                "version": "3.1.0"
              },
              "passwd": {
                "users": [
                  {
                    "name": "core",
                    "sshAuthorizedKeys": [ "PUBLIC-SSH-KEY" ]
                  }
                ]
              },
            ...
            }
            ```
            {: codeblock}

        1. Log in to your host as `core`.
            ```sh
            ssh core@<IP_address>
            ```
            {: pre}


1. Download the script and make it executable.
    ```sh
    curl https://origin.<region>.containers.cloud.ibm.com/satellite-health/sat-host-check -o sat-host-check && chmod +x sat-host-check
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    Example command for `us-south`.
    ```sh
    curl https://origin.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com/satellite-health/sat-host-check -o sat-host-check && chmod +x sat-host-check
    ```
    {: pre}
    
1. Run the script and specify the region where you created your location.
    ```sh
    sudo ./sat-host-check --region $REGION
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    Example command for `us-south`.
    
    ```sh
    sudo ./sat-host-check --region us-south
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    Example output for checking a host in `us-south`.
    ```sh

1. Review the test failure summary. Depending on the failure, review the requirements and update your hosts.
    * [Host system requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-reqs)
    * [Host storage requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-reqs-host-storage)
    * [Host network requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-reqs-host-network)
    * [Host outbound connectivity requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-reqs-host-network-outbound) and the region-specific outbound connectivity requirements for the region where you created your location.

1. If the host check succeeds, you can continue attaching the host to your location.
