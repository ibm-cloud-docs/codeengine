# Disconnected use for Satellite components 
{: #disconnected-use}

Certain features of {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong}} can be used while disconnected temporarily. See the following FAQs to understand the disconnected use for these components.
{: shortdesc}

## Understanding disconnected usage
{: #understand-disconnected}

What does disconnected usage mean?
:   When {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Locations and {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} are disconnected from the parent `managed-from` region in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, they can still run with some limitations for a certain amount of time. The limitations of disconnected usage include no security fixes and no alerts. For more information, see [Disconnected usage by component](#disconnect-usage-component).

How do I set how long my access token is valid for?
:   Edit the value of the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` parameter to set the token validity in seconds. For more information, see [Setting the disconnected usage time](#disconnect-time). 

What happens when my token expires?
:   After your token expires, you lose the ability to work with the Location. When you run a command, you get error messages such as `error: You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized)`. To recover, you must reconnect to the Location and log in again to retrieve a new token. Do not reload nodes before the Location is reconnected. If you reload nodes while the Location is disconnected, the location won't recover. 

Do I need to re-create the Location?
:   No, you don't need to re-create the Location. You can reconnect the existing Location and reauthenticate to continue working with your Location.

How do I reauthenticate? 
:   Reconnect your Location first and then log in again with your credentials. 

Do I have to recover etcd backup?
:   If you are using RHCOS hosts, you don't need to recover etcd backup. The Location recovers automatically after you reconnect it and reauthenticate. However, locations that use RHEL might need to recover etcd.

What happens if a location stays disconnected for more than 7 days?
:   After you restore your connection, you might need to replace all hosts across the location with new infrastructure.

How do I know when to reconnect a location?
:   You can make a note or set a reminder to reconnect the location before the 7-day window expires. The timer starts when you request the token. 

## Setting the disconnected usage time
{: #disconnect-time}

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Locations and {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} can run disconnected from the parent `managed-from` region in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for up to 168 hours (7 days).
{: shortdesc}

You can modify this setting by changing the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` value for all your OAuth clients. The default value for `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` parameter is 86400 seconds.

The `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` value starts counting when the user was last authenticated, not when the Location is disconnected. Note that a user must have access to IAM to authenticate.

1. Get your OAuth clients by running `oc get oauthclients`.
    
    Example output
    ```sh
    NAME                           SECRET                                        WWW-CHALLENGE   TOKEN-MAX-AGE   REDIRECT URIS

    ```
    {: screen}


2. Get your OAuth access tokens by running `oc get oauthaccesstokens`.

3. For each OAuth client that you retrieved in step 1, set the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` value by running `oc  edit oauthclients console` and adding the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 604800` as the first line. Note that you must repeat this step for all your OAuth clients.

4. Optionally, run `oc get oauthclients console -o yaml` to check whether the first line of the yaml file was updated to `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 604800`.

5. Refresh your cluster by running `ibmcloud ks cluster master refresh --cluster CLUSTERID` for the changes to take effect.

6. Run the following command to verify that the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` value was updated for your OAuth clients.
    ```sh
    oc get oauthclients -o json | jq -j '.items[]|"Name:\t", .metadata.name, "\t", "value:\t", .accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds, "\n"'
    ```
