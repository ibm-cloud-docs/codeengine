## Understanding which ODF storage template to use
{: #compare-odf}

You have two options when deploying OpenShift Data Foundation to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} clusters, which are the `odf-local` and `odf-remote` storage templates.

- [`odf-local`](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-local): Choose this template when you have local storage available to your worker nodes. If your storage volumes are visible when running `lsblk`, you can use these disks when deploying ODF if they are raw and unformatted.
- [`odf-remote`](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remote): Choose this template if you have a CSI driver installed in your cluster. For example, the `azuredisk-csi-driver` driver. You can use the CSI driver to dynamically provision storage volumes when deploying ODF.



## Can I estimate my costs?
{: #cost-estimate}
{: faq}

When you create a resource such as a location or cluster, you can review a cost estimate in the **Summary** pane of the console. For other types of estimates, see [Estimating your costs](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost#cost).

Keep in mind that some charges are not reflected in the estimate, such as the costs for your underlying infrastructure.

## Can I view and control my current usage?
{: #usage}
{: faq}
 

See [View your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage#viewingusage) and [Set spending notifications](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending) for general {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account guidance.


## Creating a storage assignment in the console
{: #assignment-create-console}

1. Select the location where you created your storage configuration.
1. Click the **Locations** tab, then click **Storage**.
1. Click the storage configuration that you want to assign to a cluster group.
1. On the **Configuration details** page, click **Create storage assignment**.
1. In the **Create an assignment** pane, enter a name for your assignment.
1. From the **Version** drop-down list, select the storage configuration version that you want to assign.
1. Click **Create** to create the assignment.
1. Verify that your storage configuration is deployed to your cluster. 
    1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/locations){: external}, navigate to your Location and select **Storage**
    1. Click the storage configuration that you created and review the **Assignments** tab.
    1. Click the **Assignment** that you created and review the **Rollout status** for your configuration.
