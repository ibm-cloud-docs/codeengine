## AWS EBS
{: #ebs-ref}

Review the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage classes for AWS EBS. You can describe storage classes in the command line with the `oc describe sc <storage-class-name>` command. Note that data volumes are automatically encrypted by an AWS managed default key. For more information, see [Default KMS key for EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html#EBSEncryption_key_mgmt){: external}. For more information on AWS EBS encryption, see [How AWS EBS encryption works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html#how-ebs-encryption-works){: external}.
