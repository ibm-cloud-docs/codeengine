# Registering clusters with {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config
{: #register-openshift-clusters}

Clusters that you create in your Satellite Location are automatically registered with {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config. You can also manually register other clusters in the public cloud or your existing {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} clusters with {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config. Follow the steps to run the registration script in your cluster to set up the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config components and make the cluster visible in {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}. 
{: shortdesc}

After you complete these steps, the cluster can be added to a cluster group in your location and [subscribed to {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} configurations](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-satcon-manage-direct-upload). However, you must still use {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} to manage the worker nodes for these clusters.
{: note}

1. Find the cluster in the public cloud that you want to attach to {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config. To list available clusters, run the `ibmcloud oc cluster ls` command or go to the [{{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters?platformType=openshift){: external}.

    Do not manually register clusters that you created in a Satellite Location. These clusters are automatically registered with {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config. Registering them again manually might cause issues in your Location or cluster. 
    {: note}

2. From the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} [**Clusters**](https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/clusters){: external} dashboard, click **Register cluster**.
3. Enter the name of your cluster and click **Register cluster**. Registering a cluster creates an entry in the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config ConfigMap. However, your cluster cannot be subscribed to a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} configuration until you install the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config agent in your cluster.
4. Copy the command that is displayed to you.
5. [Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-access_cluster) and run the command in your cluster. The command creates the `razeedeploy` project, custom resource definitions, and RBAC policies on your cluster that are required to make your cluster visible to {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config.

    Example output
    ```sh
    namespace/razeedeploy created
    serviceaccount/razeedeploy-sa created
    clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/razeedeploy-admin-cr created
    clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/razeedeploy-rb created
    job.batch/razeedeploy-job created
    ```
    {: screen}

6. Verify that all pods in the `razeedeploy` project are in a `Running` state.

    ```sh
    oc get pods -n razeedeploy
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    Example output 
    ```sh
    NAME                                                  READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

    ```
    {: screen}
    
7. Verify your cluster's status on the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} [**Clusters**](https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/clusters){: external} dashboard.
    
8. Optional: Select your cluster to view the Kubernetes resources that are deployed to the cluster.
