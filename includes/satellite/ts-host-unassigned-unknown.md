# Why do my unassigned hosts have an `Unresponsive` status?
{: #ts-host-unassigned-unknown}

When you view the hosts in your location or run the `ibmcloud sat host ls` command, your `unassigned` show an `Unresponsive` status similar to the following example.
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh
Name                        ID                     State        Status         Zone         Cluster                           Worker ID                                                 Worker IP

```

The host attach script for your location expires one year from the creation date. To make sure that hosts in your location don't have authentication issues, make sure to download a new copy of the host attach script at least once per year and update any unassigned hosts.
{: tsCauses}


To resolve this issue, remove the unassigned hosts from your location, download a new copy of the host attach script for your location, then reattach the hosts. Repeat the following steps for all unresponsive and unassigned hosts in your location.
{: tsResolve}

1. Remove the unresponsive hosts from your location.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat host rm --host HOST --location LOCATION
    ```
    {: pre}
    
2. Download a new copy of the host attach script for your location.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat host attach --location LOCATION [--host-label "LABEL"]  [--operating-system (RHEL|RHCOS)] [-q] [--reset-key]
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Reattach the hosts by running the attach script that you downloaded in the previous step. For more information, see [Attaching hosts to your location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-attach-hosts).


When your host attach script expires, you cannot use it to attach hosts. For more information, see [Why is my host attach failing with error message `A0029` `Access denied to specified controller`](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-ts-host-expired-token)?
