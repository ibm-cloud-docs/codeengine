# Manually creating {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} locations
{: #loc-manual-create}

You can create {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} locations for each place that you like, such as your company's ports in the north and south of the country. A {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location represents a data center that you fill with your own infrastructure resources to run your own workloads and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.
{: shortdesc}

Do not reuse the same name for multiple locations, even after the other location is deleted. If you use the same name 5 times or more within 7 days, you might reach the Let's Encrypt [Duplicate Certificate rate limit](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cs_rate_limit).
{: note}

## Manually creating locations from the console
{: #location-create-console}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} console to create your location.
{: shortdesc}


Before you begin:

- [Find out more about locations and hosts](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-location-host).
- [Plan your infrastructure](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-infrastructure-plan).
- [Verify your host setup](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-network-check).
- Make sure that you have the [correct permissions](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-iam#iam-roles-usecases) to create locations. For more information, see [Checking user permissions](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-iam-assign-access#checking-perms).
- {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} uses {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} to store data about your location and backups for your location's clusters. You can choose to have a bucket created automatically when you create your location or specify an existing bucket. If you want to use an existing bucket, it must have cross-regional resiliency.


To create a location, open the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/locations){: external} and select **Create location**.

Getting started options
:    The following options determine your installation process.
:    - If your infrastructure is on prem or edge, select the **On prem and Edge** option. With this option, you create a location, choose your zones, and download a host attach script to run on your hosts.
:    - If your infrastructure is a cloud provider and you want to use only hosts that are running RHEL, select the cloud provider that you want to use, enter your credentials, and create your location. You can also [download the terraform template](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-satellite/tree/main/examples){: external} and edit it before you run it.
:    - If your infrastructure is a cloud provider and you want to use hosts that are running RHCOS or want to have more control over your host creation, then select **Advanced configuration**. With this option, you create a location, choose your zones, include your cloud provider credentials, and then download a host attach script (RHEL) or an ignition script (RHCOS) to run on your hosts.

:    If you selected **On prem and Edge**, you can change your location options by clicking **Edit**.
     {: tip}


{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location options
:    The following options define your location.
:    - **Name**: The {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location name must start with a letter, can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), and hyphen (-), and must be 35 characters or fewer. Do not reuse the same name for multiple locations, even if you deleted another location with the same name.
:    - **Resource group**: Resource groups organize your account resources in customizable groupings so that you can quickly assign users access to more than one resource at a time. This value is set to `default` by default.  
:    - **Description** and **Tags**: Descriptions and tags help you organize your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources.
:    - **Managed from**: The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region that you want to use to manage your location. For more information about why you must select an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region, see [About {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} regions for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-sat-regions#understand-supported-regions). Make sure to select the region that is closest to where your host machines physically reside that you plan to attach to your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location to ensure low network latency between your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
:    - **Zones**: The names of the zones **must match exactly** the names of the corresponding zones in your infrastructure provider where you plan to create hosts, such as a cloud provider zone or on-prem rack. To retrieve the name of the zone for other cloud providers, consult your infrastructure provider.
         - [Alibaba regions and zones](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ecs/product-overview/regions-and-zones/){: external}, such as `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`.

:    - **Object Storage**: The exact name of an existing {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket that you want to use to back up {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane data. Otherwise, a new bucket is automatically created in an {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance in your account. **Do not delete** your {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance or this bucket. If the service instance or bucket is deleted, your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane data cannot be backed up.

After you click **Create**, you can [attach hosts to your location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-attach-hosts) and finish the setup of your [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-setup-control-plane). Note that the token in the attach script is an API key, which must be treated and protected as sensitive information. 

The host attach script for your location expires one year from the creation date. To make sure that hosts in your location don't have authentication issues, download a new copy of the host attach script at least once per year and update any unassigned hosts. For more information, see [Why do my unassigned hosts have an `Unresponsive` status?](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-ts-host-unassigned-unknown).

    `--service-subnet SUBNET`
    :    Optional. Specify a custom subnet CIDR to provide private IP addresses for services. This option can be used only if you also enable Red Hat CoreOS with the `--coreos-enabled` option. All services that are deployed to the cluster are assigned a private IP address in the 172.20.0.0/16 range by default. You can avoid subnet conflicts with the network that you use to connect to your location by specifying a custom subnet CIDR that provides the private IP addresses for your services.
    :    The subnet must be specified in CIDR format with a size of at least `/24`, which allows a maximum of 255 services in the cluster, or larger. The subnet that you choose must be within one of the following ranges.
         - `172.16.0.0 - 172.17.255.255`
         - `172.20.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`

         - `198.18.0.0 - 198.19.255.255`
 
    :    Note that the pod and service subnets can't overlap. The pod subnet is in the 172.16.0.0/16 range by default. This value can't be set to the value of the related location's pod-subnet or service-subnet.

    `--pod-network-interface-selection METHOD`
    :    Optional. The method for selecting the node network interface for the internal pod network. The available methods are `can-reach` and `interface`. This option can be used only if you also enable Red Hat CoreOS with the `--operating-system` option. 
         - To provide a direct URL or IP address, specify `can-reach=<url>` or `can-reach=<ip_address>`. If the network interface can reach the provided URL or IP address, this option is used. For example, use `can-reach=www.exampleurl.com` for specifying a URL and `can-reach=172.19.0.0` for specifying an IP address.
         - To choose an interface with a Regex string, specify `interface=<regex_string>`; for example, `interface=eth.*`

    `--provider INFRASTRUCTURE_PROVIDER`
    :    Optional. The name of the infrastructure provider to create the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location in. Accepted values are `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`, and `vmware`. If you include this option, you must also include the `--provider-credential` option.

    `--provider-region PROVIDER_REGION`
    :    Optional. The name of the region in the infrastructure provider where you plan to create all the hosts for the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location, such as `us-east-1` in AWS.

    `--provider-credential PATH_TO_PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL`
    :    Optional. The path to a JSON file on your local machine that has the credentials of the infrastructure provider for the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location. The credential format is provider-specific. For more information, see [Providing {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} with credentials to your infrastructure provider](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-infrastructure-plan). If you include this option, you must also include the `--provider` option.


    `-q`
    :    Optional. Do not show the message of the day or update reminders.

        
3. Verify that your location is created and wait for the location **Status** to change to `action required`. When you create the location, a location management plane is deployed to the region that you selected during location creation. During this process, the **Status** of the location shows `deploying`. While the master deploys, you can now attach compute capacity to your location to complete the setup of the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane.


    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat location ls
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    Name         ID                     Status            Ready   Created        Hosts (used/total)   Managed From   
    mylocation   brhtfum2015a6mgqj16g   action required   no      1 minute ago   0 / 3                Washington DC
