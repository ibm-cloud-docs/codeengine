# OpenShift Data Foundation using local disks
{: #storage-odf-local}

Set up OpenShift Data Foundation for {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong}} clusters. You can use {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage templates to create storage configurations. When you assign a storage configuration to your clusters, the storage drivers of the selected storage provider are installed in your cluster. Be aware that charges occur when you use the OpenShift Data Foundation service. Use the Cost Estimator to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.
{: shortdesc}

OpenShift Data Foundation is available in only internal mode, which means that your apps run in the same cluster as your storage. External mode, or storage heavy configurations, where your storage is located in a separate cluster from your apps is not supported.
{: note}

Before you can deploy storage templates to clusters in your location, make sure you set up {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config by selecting the **Enable cluster admin access for Satellite Config** option in the console or including the `--enable-config-admin` option when you create your cluster.
{: important}

You cannot scope {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage service to resource groups. However, if you are scoping other resources such as location and cluster to resource groups, you need to add {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reader and link administrator role for all resources in the account.
{: note}

{{site.data.content.compare-odf}}

The ODF cluster add-on is not supported on {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} clusters. You must use either the `odf-local` or `odf-remote` storage template to deploy ODF on {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}.
{: note}

## Prerequisites for ODF
{: #sat-storage-odf-local-prereq}

To use the ODF storage with the local storage operator and local storage devices, complete the following tasks:

1. Make sure you have the following permissions.
    - **Editor** for the Billing service.
    - **Manager** and **Editor** for Kubernetes service.
    - **Satellite Link Administrator** and **Reader** for the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} service.
1. [Create a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations).
1. [Create a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-satellite-clusters).
    - Make sure that you select the **Enable cluster admin access for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config** option when you create the cluster. If you don't enable Administrator (admin) access for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Config when creating your cluster, you must re-create your cluster and enable admin access before you can deploy storage.
    - Your cluster must have a minimum of 3 worker nodes with at least 16CPUs and 64GB RAM per worker node.
    - Your hosts must meet the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} host requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-reqs) in addition to having one of the following local storage configurations.
        * One extra raw device per worker node in addition to the minimum host requirements. This disk must not be partitioned or have formatted file systems.
        * One extra raw partition per worker node in addition to the minimum host requirements. If your host storage devices are partitioned, they must have at least one extra raw/unformatted partition per disk, per worker node.
        * Two extra raw devices per worker node in addition to the minimum host requirements. These disks must not be partitioned or formatted file systems. If your devices are not partitioned, each node must have 2 free disks. One disk for the OSD and one disk for the MON.
        * Two extra raw partitions per worker node in addition to the minimum host requirements. These disks must not be  formatted file systems. If your raw devices are partitioned, they must have at least 2 partitions per disk, per worker node.
1. **Optional**: If you want to use {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} as your object service, [Create an {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} service instance](#sat-storage-odf-local-cos) and HMAC credentials. The {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance that you create is used as the NooBaa backing store in your ODF configuration. The backing store is the underlying storage for the data in your NooBaa buckets. If you don't specify an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance when you create your storage configuration, the default NooBaa backing store is configured. You can create additional backing stores, including {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} backing stores after your storage configuration is assigned to your clusters and ODF is installed.
1. **Optional**: [Get the details of the raw, unformatted devices that you want to use for your configuration](#sat-storage-odf-local-devices). The device IDs of your storage disks are used to create your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage configuration.
1. **Optional**: If you are using VMWare hosts, make sure you set the `disk.EnableUUID` parameter to `TRUE` in your virtual machine settings.


## (Optional) Setting up an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} backing store for ODF
{: #sat-storage-odf-local-cos}

If you want to use {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} as your object service, create an {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} service instance and HMAC credentials. The {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance that you create is the NooBaa backing store in your ODF configuration. The backing store is the underlying storage for the data in your NooBaa buckets. If you don't specify an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance when you create your storage configuration, the default NooBaa backing store is configured. You can create more backing stores, including {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} backing stores after assigning the configuration to to your clusters and installing ODF.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource service-instance-create noobaa-store cloud-object-storage standard global
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Create HMAC credentials and note the service access key and access key ID of your HMAC credentials.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource service-key-create cos-cred-rw Writer --instance-name noobaa-store --parameters '{"HMAC": true}'
    ```
    {: pre}


## (Optional) Getting the device details for your ODF configuration
{: #sat-storage-odf-local-devices}

The following steps show how you can manually retrieve the local device information from each worker node in your cluster. Note that for version 4.8 clusters and later, you can automatically find the available devices on your worker nodes by setting the `auto-discover-devices=true` parameter. However, if you have a 4.7 cluster, you must complete the following steps to retrieve the device paths for the disks on your worker nodes.
{: important}

When you create your ODF configuration, you must specify the device paths of the disks that you want to use in your storage cluster. The storage cluster is comprised of the object storage daemon (OSD) pods and the monitoring (MON) pods. The devices that you specify as OSD devices are your storage devices where your app data is stored and the devices that you specify as MON devices are managed by the MON pod and used to store and maintain the storage cluster mapping and monitor storage events. For more information about the OSD and MON, see the [Ceph documentation](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/start/intro/){: external}.

1. Log in to your cluster and get a list of available worker nodes. Make a note of the worker nodes that you want to use in your ODF configuration.

    ```sh
    oc get nodes
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Log in to each worker node that you want to use for your ODF configuration.

    ```sh
    oc debug node/<node-name>
    ```
    {: pre}

1. When the debug pod is deployed on the worker node, run the following commands to list the available disks on the worker node.

    1. Allow host binaries.
    
        ```sh
        chroot /host
        ```
        {: pre}

    1. List your devices.
    
        ```sh
        lsblk
        ```
        {: pre}

1. Review the command output for available disks. Disks that can be used for your ODF configuration must be unmounted. In the following example output from the `lsblk` command, the `sdc` disk has two available, unformatted partitions that you can use for the OSD and MON device paths for this worker node. If your worker node has raw disks without partitions, you need one disk for the OSD and one disk for the MON. As a best practice, and to maximize storage capacity on this disk, you can specify the smaller partition or disk for the MON, and the larger partition or disk for the OSD. Note that the initial storage capacity of your ODF configuration is equal to the size of the disk that you specify as the `osd-device-path` when you create your configuration.


    ```sh
    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda      8:0    0   931G  0 disk
    |-sda1   8:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
    |-sda2   8:2    0     1G  0 part
    `-sda3   8:3    0 929.8G  0 part /
    sdb      8:16   0 744.7G  0 disk
    `-sdb1   8:17   0 744.7G  0 part /disk1
    sdc      8:32   0 744.7G  0 disk
    |-sdc1   8:33   0  18.6G  0 part
    `-sdc2   8:34   0 260.8G  0 part
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Find the `by-id` for each disk that you want to use in your configuration. In this case, the `sdc1` and `sdc2` partitions are unformatted and unmounted. The `by-id` for each disk is specified as a command parameter when you create your configuration.

    ```sh
    ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    If you have VMware hosts, run the following command.
    
    ```sh
    ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
    ```
    {: pre}
    
1. Review the command output and make a note of the `by-id` values for the disks that you want to use in your configuration. In the following example output, the disk ids for the `sdc1` and `sdc2` partitions are: `scsi-3600605b00d87b43027b3bc310a64c6c9-part1` and `scsi-3600605b00d87b43027b3bc310a64c6c9-part2`.
    ```sh

## Deploying an app that uses OpenShift Data Foundation
{: #sat-storage-odf-local-deploy}


You can use the ODF storage classes to create PVCs for the apps in your clusters.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a YAML configuration file for your PVC. In order for the PVC to match the PV, you must use the same values for the storage class and the size of the storage.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: ocs-pvc
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      storageClassName: sat-ocs-cephfs-gold
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 5Gi
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Create the PVC in your cluster.

    ```sh
    oc apply -f pvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Create a YAML configuration file for a pod that mounts the PVC that you created. The following example creates an `nginx` pod that writes the current date and time to a `test.txt` file.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: nginx
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do echo $(date -u) >> /test/test.txt; sleep 5; done"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: persistent-storage
          mountPath: /test
      volumes:
      - name: persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: ocs-pvc
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Create the pod in your cluster.

    ```sh
    oc apply -f pod.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that the pod is deployed. Note that it might take a few minutes for your app to get into a `Running` state.

    ```sh
    oc get pods
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    app                                 1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Verify that the app can write data.

    1. Log in to your pod.
    
        ```sh
        oc exec <app-pod-name> -it bash
        ```
        {: pre}

    1. Display the contents of the `test.txt` file to confirm that your app can write data to your persistent storage.
    
        ```sh
        cat /test/test.txt
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:19 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:25 UTC 2021
        Tue Mar 2 20:09:31 UTC 2021

        Tue Mar 2 20:09:47 UTC 2021
        ```
        {: screen}

    1. Exit the pod.

## Scaling your ODF configuration by attaching raw disks
{: #sat-storage-scale-odf-local-disk}


To scale your ODF configuration by adding disks to your worker nodes, increase the `num-of-osd` parameter value and specify the new worker node names with the `worker-nodes` parameter.

In the following example, 3 worker nodes are added to the configuration that was created previously. You can scale your configuration by adding updating the command parameters as follows:
- `--name` - Create a configuration with a new name.
- `--template-name` - Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration.
- `--template-version` - Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration.
- `osd-device-path` - Specify all previous `osd-device-path` values from your existing configuration and the device paths from the worker nodes that you have added to your cluster. To retrieve the device ID values for your new worker nodes, see [Getting you device details](#sat-storage-odf-local-devices).
- `mon-device-path` - Specify all previous `mon-device-path` values from your existing configuration. ODF requires 3 MON devices. To retrieve the device ID values for your new worker nodes, see [Getting your device details](#sat-storage-odf-local-devices).
- `num-of-osd` - Increase the OSD number by 1 for each set of 3 disks or partitions that you add to your configuration.
- `worker-nodes` - Specify the worker nodes from your existing configuration.
- `ibm-cos-access-key` - Optional: Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration. Do not specify this parameter if you don't use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration.
- `ibm-cos-secret-access-key` - Optional: Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration. Do not specify this parameter if you don't use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration.
- `ibm-cos-endpoint` - Optional: Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration. Do not specify this parameter if you don't use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration.
- `ibm-cos-location` - Optional: Use the same parameter value as in your existing configuration. Do not specify this parameter if you don't use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration.

1. Create the storage configuration and specify the updated values. In this example, the `osd-device-path` parameter is updated to include the device IDs of the disks that you want to use and the `num-of-osd` value is increased to 2. Do not specify the {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} parameters when you create your configuration if you don't use an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance as your backing store in your existing configuration.

If you set the `auto-discover-devices` parameter to `true` in your ODF configuration, you can scale your configuration by increasing the `num-of-osd` parameter value in the following command.

```sh
ibmcloud sat storage config param set --config <config-name> -p num-of-osd=2 --apply
```
{: pre}



    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage config create --name odf-local --template-name odf-local --template-version 4.11 --location odf-sat-stage-location  -p "auto-discover-devices=true" -p "iam-api-key=<api-key>"
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Assign your configuration to your clusters.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment create --name <name> --group <group> --config <config>

## Removing OpenShift Data Foundation from your apps
{: #odf-local-rm}


If you no longer need your OpenShift Data Foundation, you can remove your PVC, PV, and the ODF operator from your clusters.
{: shortdesc}

1. List your PVCs and note the name of the PVC and the corresponding PV that you want to remove.
    ```sh
    oc get pvc
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Remove any pods that mount the PVC.
    1. List all the pods that currently mount the PVC that you want to delete. If no pods are returned, you don't have any pods that currently use your PVC.
        ```sh
        oc get pods --all-namespaces -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName}{" "}{end}{end}' | grep "<pvc_name>"
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        app    sat-ocs-cephfs-gold
        ```
        {: screen}

    1. Remove the pod that uses the PVC. If the pod is part of a deployment, remove the deployment.
        ```sh
        oc delete pod <pod_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

        ```sh
        oc delete deployment <deployment_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

    1. Verify that the pod or the deployment is removed.
        ```sh
        oc get pods
        ```
        {: pre}

        ```sh
        oc get deployments
        ```
        {: pre}

1. Delete the PVC.
    ```sh
    oc delete pvc <pvc_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

## Removing the ODF local storage configuration from your cluster
{: #odf-local-template-rm}


If you no longer plan to use OpenShift Data Foundation in your cluster, you can remove the assignment from your cluster from the storage configuration.
{: shortdesc}

Note that if you remove the storage configuration, the ODF operators is then uninstalled from all assigned clusters. Your PVCs, PVs, and data are not removed. However, you might not be able to access your data until you re-install the driver in your cluster again.
{: important}

1. Run the following command to delete your ODF storage assignment.
    ```sh
    oc delete ocscluster --all
    ```
    {: pre}


1. List your storage assignments and find the one that you used for your cluster.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment ls (--cluster CLUSTER | --config CONFIG | --location LOCATION | --service-cluster-id CLUSTER)
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Remove the assignment. After the assignment is removed, the ODF driver pods and storage classes are removed from all clusters that were part of the storage assignment.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment rm --assignment <assignment_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}



1. List the ODF and local storage classes.

    ```sh
    oc get sc
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    localblock                    kubernetes.io/no-provisioner            Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  42m

    ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd   openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com      Delete          Immediate              true                   41m
    ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rgw   openshift-storage.ceph.rook.io/bucket   Delete          Immediate              false                  41m
    ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Delete the storage classes.

    ```sh
    oc delete sc localblock localfile ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rgw ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
    ```
    {: pre}
