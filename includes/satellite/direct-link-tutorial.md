Supported location type
:   Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS)-enabled locations only

Supported host operating systems
:   Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS)

Use a secure {{site.data.keyword.dl_full}} connection for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link communications between your services running in an {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong}} Location and {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.
{: shortdesc}

In this tutorial, you set up your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link to use a {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} connection. The Link tunnel client at your Location sends traffic over the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} connection to a Relay that you create in your  {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. This Relay proxies the traffic to Link tunnel server's IP address in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network.

## FAQ
{: #faq-direct-link}

Is the cost of the relay compute resources included in the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} service costs?
:   The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources used for the relay and {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} are billed separately.

Are there additional charges to access {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services over Direct Link?
:   No, there are not additional charges for accessing services over Direct Link. 

Why do I need Direct Link?
:   Normally, outbound traffic from your Location to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services might flow over the public internet. When you use Direct Link, outbound traffic from your Location flows through the Direct Link, rather than using the public Internet.

My organization disables Internet access by design. Can I create and maintain Locations and hosts attached to the Location with Direct Link?
:   If you have Direct Link, you can use it for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} services. With Direct Link, you can create Locations and attach hosts without access to public Internet.

Can I use RHEL hosts to set up my Direct Link?
:   No. You must have both an RHCOS-enabled location and you must use RHCOS hosts in your location to use Direct Link.

Can I redirect all traffic to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} over Direct Link instead of Internet?
:   Currently, not all services support Direct Link. So, depending on the services you use it might or might not be possible for all traffic to use Direct Link.

What {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services can I access over Direct Link to avoid accessing them over Internet?
:   After following these instructions, {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} and Openshift on {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} will work across Direct Link. Additional services deployed into a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location might have features that require public Internet access. It is recommended to consult the documentation for each service running in a location to verify their connectivity requirements.

If I have two Locations that use Direct Link, can I use them for Direct Link to fail over from one Location to the other?
:   This functionality is not yet available.

How do I size Direct Link capacity for my Location?
:   There are no additional sizing requirements for using Direct Link. So, you can size your Location like a normal Location, meaning based on the services you will use.  

Can I have one-click deployment of everything needed to enable Direct Link to avoid manual errors?
:   Currently, a one-click deployment for Direct Link is not available. It might be available at a future time.

## Target use case
{: #target-use-case}

Customers who are currently using {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} between IBM and on-prem or other public clouds, can continue to use it for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link. This allows customers to:

- Access services on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} from a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location over {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}; examples are backups in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}, sending metrics to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}, tracking events in {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong_notm}}, or sending logs to {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}}.
- Access services running in a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
- Access public cloud services outside of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

These can be accessed using {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} endpoints addresses created to route traffic over {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} instead of the internet.

This prevents customer’s sensitive data going over the public internet such as logging, backups or data between integrated services across the hybrid cloud landscape. This also helps optimize ingress/egress charges.

## Overview
{: #dl-overview}

By default, two {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link components, the tunnel server and the connector, proxy network traffic between {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and resources in your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location over a secure TLS connection. This document covers the use case of using a TLS connection over Direct Link.

This setup uses the tunnel server's private cloud service endpoint to route traffic over the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network(`166.9.0.0/8`, see [Service network](/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges#service-network). However, communication to the tunnel server's private cloud service endpoint must go through the 166.9.X.X/16 IP address range on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network, which is not routable from {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}}.

To enable access to the `166.9.X.X/16` range, create a Relay in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, which will reverse proxy incoming traffic to the tunnel server's private cloud service endpoint. By default, the Relay Ingress has an IP address in the internal `10.X.X.X/8` IP address range, which is accessible via a {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} connection.

The following diagram demonstrates the flow of traffic.

![{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Link setup that uses a {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} connection and a reverse proxy](/images/sat_dl_architecture.svg){: caption="Figure 1. Satellite Link setup that uses a DirectLink connection" caption-side="bottom"}
  
1. Network traffic originating at your Location, such as a request from an {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} cluster to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service, is routed via Link Service over Direct Link to the Relay Private Ingress, which has a Direct link routable address.
2. The Relay initiates a new session to forward the request to the private cloud service endpoint of the tunnel server, which terminates to an IP address in the `166.9.X.X/16` range (Link private address).

## Objectives
{: #dl-objectives}

You can create Red Hat CoreOS enabled Locations without accessing public Internet. All traffic is handled by {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} and stays internal.
{: shortdesc}

High level steps include:

1. Create a Red Hat CoreOS enabled {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Location with your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account that terminates your {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}.
2. Create a relay, which is a reverse proxy that supports http/https and secure websocket.
3. Provision Red Hat CoreOS hosts. Customize the hosts by using ignition script that are downloaded as attach script for the Location created in Step 1.

## Prerequisites
{: #dl-prereq}

- You must have a Red Hat CoreOS enabled {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Location. If you don't have one already, follow the instructions in [Creating a Red Hat CoreOS enabled {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Location](#dl-create-coreos-location) to create it.
- {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} is available between target {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} specific VPC or classic clusters.
- Ensure that your [{{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}}](/docs/dl?topic=dl-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl) connection can access the `10.X.X.X/8` IP address range. Review network design to avoid IP conflicts between two ends of {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}.
- [Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and plug-ins](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-cli-install) and [install the Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-install).
- Ensure that your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account is Virtual Router Function (VRF) enabled to use service endpoints.
- Ensure you have the following access policies. For more information, see [Checking user permissions](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-iam-assign-access#checking-perms).

## Creating a Red Hat CoreOS enabled {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Location 
{: #dl-create-coreos-location}
{: step}  

You can skip this step if you already have a Red Hat CoreOS enabled {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Location.
{: note}

Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account that has {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} and create a Red Hat CoreOS enabled {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Location. For more information, see [Creating a Satellite location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations#verify-coreos-location).
{: shortdesc}
  
## Creating a relay 
{: #dl-create-coreos-relay}  
{: step}

The relay is an http/https reverse proxy that supports secure Websocket connections. It can run on VSI, {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} as Classic or VPC. The following steps demonstrates an example for deploying NGINX reverse proxy on a private-only VPC {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster (on VPC private nodes). 
{: shortdesc}
  
One essential requirement is to have a valid name that can be assigned to the cluster private ingress (Relay Ingress) and a valid certificate on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. On {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, VPC {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} clusters on private nodes come with default private host name and certificate. You can use them or bring your custom host name and certificate. This example uses the default private host name and certificates.  
  
VPC clusters considerations for this scenario:

- Zone: Any multizone-capable VPC zone
- Worker node flavor: Any VPC infrastructure flavor
- Version: 4.x.x
- Worker pool: At least 2 worker nodes
- Subnets: Include Ingress Load Balancer IP subnets if the default ranges conflict with the `--pod-subnet` and `--service-subnet` values of the {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster on Satellite or the network CIDR where the Satellite or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} hosts are deployed on-premise.
- Cloud service endpoints: Do not specify the `--disable-public-service-endpoint` option if you want both public and private endpoints. 
- Spread the default worker pool across zones to increase the availability of your classic or VPC cluster.
- Ensure that at least 2 worker nodes exist in each zone, so that the private ALBs that you configure in subsequent steps are highly available and can properly receive version updates.

In the following example, we create a private-only VPC cluster and use the private Ingress controller that is created by default. However, you can also use a {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster with a public cloud service endpoint enabled, but in this case your cluster is created with only a public Ingress controller by default. If you want to set up your relay by using a cluster with a public service endpoint, you must first enable the private Ingress controller and register it with a subdomain and certificate by following the steps in [Setting up Ingress](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ingress-roks4).
{: note}

1. Create a private-only {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster on VPC. For more information, see [Creating VPC clusters](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cluster-create-vpc-gen2&interface=ui). 


    There are many ways to expose apps in {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster in a VPC. In this example, the app will be privately exposed with private endpoints only, which is the most common use case for {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} customers. {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} clusters that are privately exposed with private endpoints only come with default private name and certificate. They will be used in this example to expose the NGINX reverse proxy pods. You can use the default ones or bring your custom host name and certificate. For more details, see [Privately exposing apps in VPC clusters with a private cloud service endpoint only](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ingress-private-expose#priv-se-priv-controller).
    {: note}
    
1. Create a Secretes Manager instance and register it to the {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster that was created in the previous step. For more information, see [Creating a Secrets Manager service instance](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-create-instance&interface=ui).

1. Get the Ingress details from {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc cluster get --cluster CLUSTER_NAME_OR_ID | grep Ingress
    ```
    {: pre}   

    Example output:
    ```sh
    Ingress Subdomain:      mycluster-i000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
    Ingress Secret:         mycluster-i000
    ```
    {: screen}

    In this scenario, if you run the **`nslookup`** command to the Ingress Subdomain, it resolves to IBM service private IP address (`10.0.0.0/8`). Adding routes to make the Ingress IP address (`10.0.0.0/8`) reachable from customer on-prem is not covered in this document. You are responsible for facilitating routing between on-prem and the Ingress relay on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
    {: note}

1. Get the secrete CRN.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc ingress secret get -c CLUSTER --name SECRET_NAME --namespace openshift-ingress
    ```
    {: pre}
    
1. Create a namespace for the NGINX reverse proxy.
    ```sh
    kubectl create ns dl-reverse-proxy
    ```
    {: pre} 

1. Copy the default TLS secret from `openshift-ingress` to the project where NGINX is going to deployed.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc ingress secret create --cluster CLUSTER_NAME_OR_ID --cert-crn CRN --name SECRET_NAME --namespace dl-reverse-proxy 
    ```
    {: pre}  
  
1. Copy the following Ingress resource file content into your local directory. Replace `VALUE_FROM_INGRESS_SUBDOMAIN` and `VALUE_FROM_INGRESS_SECRET` with your own values.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: dl-ingress-resource
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "public-iks-k8s-nginx"
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "3600"
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "3600"
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - satellite-dl.VALUE_FROM_INGRESS_SUBDOMAIN
        secretName: VALUE_FROM_INGRESS_SECRET
      rules:
      - host: satellite-dl.VALUE_FROM_INGRESS_SUBDOMAIN
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: nginxsvc
                port:
                  number: 80


    ```
    {: codeblock}
    
1. Create the Ingress.
    ```sh
    oc apply -f myingressresource.yaml -n <dl-reverse-proxy>
    ```
    {: pre} 

1. Get the tunnel server {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} internal Ingress host name by running the following command.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat endpoint ls --location LOCATION_ID
    ```
    {: pre}   
  
1. From the output, take a note of the Location endpoint. Replace `c-01`, `c-02`, or `c-03` with `d-01-ws`, `d-02-ws`, or `d-03-ws` and remove the port. For example, `c-01.private.us-south.link.satellite.cloud.ibm.com:40934` becomes `d-01-ws.private.us-south.link.satellite.cloud.ibm.com`. This value can be used as the value for `proxy_pass https` in the ConfigMap file.

1. Copy the NGINX ConfigMap file content into your local directory. This configuration either applies ws-reverse proxy or https reverse proxy to the tunnel server {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} endpoint. Replace `VALUE_FROM_INGRESS_SUBDOMAIN` and `VALUE_FOR_PROXY_PASS` with your own values.

## Provisioning Red Hat CoreOS hosts 
{: #dl-provision-coreos-hosts}
{: step}

Now the relay is ready and incoming traffic to the relay can be proxied to the tunnel server internal Ingress. {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} agent must be deployed on the hosts to establish the connection to the tunnel server internally through the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}.
{: shortdesc}

1. Download the Location attach script. Make sure you download the `.ign` file by selecting **Red Hat CoreOS** in the console when you download or using `ibmcloud sat host attach --location LOCATION --operating-system RHCOS` in the CLI.

1. Get the user token on the account where you are creating your Location.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
    ```
    {: pre}     
  
1. Use the token in the following curl command. Depending on your location or region, the URL is different. The following example command uses `us-south`. But if your location is in Frankfurt, replace `us-south` with `eu-de`.
    ```sh
    curl -X GET \
    'https://api.us-south.link.satellite.cloud.ibm.com/v1/linkagentdownloadurl/LOCATION-ID?linktunnelhostname=INGRESS-SUBDOMAIN' \
    --header 'Accept: */*' \
    --header 'User-Agent: IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service - service-engine' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' 
    ```
    {: pre}  

    Example output:
    ```sh
    {"tunnel_host":"","location_id":"","auth_code":""}
    ```
    {: screen}    

1. Create a script named `ign_tool.js` with the following content.
    ```sh
     /**
     * This is a tool to help set up ibm-link-agent-hn systemd service. 
     * It's a temporary solution and wil be useless when the IBM Cloud CLI feature is added. 
     * 
     * The tool requires two parameters, 
     * 1. ign file to be modified and
     * 2. the single quoted string of /v1/linkagentdownloadurl API call result .
     * 
     * It will generate a new ign file with the names as <input_file>_modified.ign , and several intermediate files as debug_xxx for debug purpose.
     *
     * Example: 
     * node ign_tool.js downloaded.ign '{"tunnel_host":"c-01-ws.us-south.link.satellite.cloud.ibm.com","location_id":"cdcnlr820p5snpe0bte0","auth_code":"70a65b5d6e94da10xxxx"}'
     * 
     * The result is a new file named downloaded_modified.ign, which should be used as an ign file to create new RHCOS host with.
     *

1. Run the script.
    ```sh

    ```
    {: pre} 

Now you have the script. Depending on your infrastructure, you can create your Red Hat CoreOS Location.
