# Using service endpoints with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}
{: #serviceendpt}

All {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} projects offer integration with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} service endpoints. This support gives you the ability to connect from your classic infrastructure  to {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} workloads and stay within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network.
{: shortdesc}

You can control the visibility of {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} workloads and specify whether to expose the application or function to public or private endpoints. An application or function that is configured for `visibility = private`, is accessed through service endpoints.  Applications or functions that are accessed through a service endpoint do not leave the IBM network and stay within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network.

## Public endpoints
{: #serviceendpt-public-endpoints}

Public endpoints provide a connection to your deployment on the public network. At provision time, a public endpoint is the default option for all deployments. Your environment needs to have internet access to connect to a deployment.

## Private endpoints
{: #serviceendpt-private-endpoints}

A deployment with a service endpoint on the private network gets an endpoint that is not accessible from the public internet. All traffic is routed to hardware dedicated to {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} deployments and remains on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. All traffic to and from this endpoint is free and does not incur charges on the condition that the traffic remains in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. After your environment has access to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network, an internet connection is not required to connect to your deployment.



{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} application deployments with private endpoints are reachable from any account within the private network and access to each instance requires authentication. To restrict this access to specific IP addresses, ranges of IP addresses, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, or VPCs, configure [context-based restriction rules](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cbr-inbound).

## Managing {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} resources securely by using service endpoints
{: #serviceendpt-ce-manageresources}


1. Specify a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project to use the private endpoint. You can configure a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project to use the private endpoint only with the CLI. To create a project, use the  [**`ibmcloud ce project create`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-create) command with the `--endpoint=private` option.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce project create --name myproject --endpoint=private
    ```
    {: pre}

    Wait until the project is in `active` status. With the CLI, you can confirm the project status by using the  [**`ibmcloud ce project get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-get) command.

    If you want an existing {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project to use the private endpoint, use the [**`ibmcloud ce project select`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-select) command with the `--endpoint=private` option.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce project select --name myproject --endpoint=private
    ```
    {: pre}

    For the **`project create`** and **`project select`** commands, if the `--endpoint` option is not explicitly specified, the behavior is determined by the system. If the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI is connected to `private.cloud.ibm.com`, the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project behaves as if `--endpoint` is `private`. If the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI is connected to `cloud.ibm.com`, the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project behaves as if `--endpoint` is `public`.
    {: important}

2. If you did not create a new project and you selected an existing project, and you want your app to only be visible to the private endpoint, confirm the existing project supports applications with private visibility. Use the  [**`ibmcloud ce project get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-get) command to verify the output for `Application Private Visibility Supported` is set to `true`. If the value is `false`, [contact IBM support](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-get-support) to enable this capability within your existing project.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce project get -n myproject
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Getting project 'myproject'...
    OK

3. Create an application or function that is only visible to the private endpoint. Use the  [**`ibmcloud ce application create`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-create) or the [**`ibmcloud ce function create`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-function-create) command with the `--visibility=private` option. Alternatively, you can use the console to create or update an app or function and set the [visibility of your app](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#optionsvisibility).

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce application create -n myapp --visibility=private
    ```
    {: pre}



## Accessing your app securely with service endpoints
{: #serviceendpt-ce-access-app}


1. From your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project, confirm that your application is configured with a `visibility=private` setting. See [Deploying your app with a private endpoint](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#app-endpoint-private).

2. Retrieve the URL of the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} application that is exposed to the private network. The URL is in the following format: `<app>.<uuid>.private.<region>.codeengine.appdomain.cloud`.
    * From the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} console, go to the **Domain mappings** tab for your application to view the visibility of an app and its available URLs.
    * From the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-install-cli), use the [**`ibmcloud ce application get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-get) command with the `--option url` option. In the following example, because the visibility of the `myapp` is set to  `visibility=private`, specifying `--option url` with this command outputs the URL to the private network.

        ```txt
        ibmcloud ce application get -n myapp -output url
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output

        ```txt
        http://myapp.4svg40kna19.private.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
        ```
        {: screen}

3. Call the application. The `myapp` application is a simple Hello World application. When you curl the `myapp` app, `Hello World` is returned.

   ```txt
   curl http://myapp.4svg40kna19.private.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
    ```
   {: pre}


## Accessing your function securely with service endpoints
{: #serviceendpt-ce-access-fun}


1. From your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project, confirm that your function is configured with a `visibility=private` setting. See [Deploying your function with a private endpoint](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-work#fun-endpoint-private).

2. Retrieve the URL of the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} function that is exposed to the private network. The URL is in the following format: `<function>.<uuid>.private.<region>.codeengine.appdomain.cloud`.
    * From the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} console, go to the **Domain mappings** tab for your function to view the visibility of the function and its available URLs.
    * From the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-install-cli), use the [**`ibmcloud ce function get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-get) command. In the following example, because the visibility of the `myfunction` is set to  `visibility=private`, this command outputs the URL to the private network.

        ```txt
        ibmcloud ce function get -n myfunction
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output

        ```txt
        http://myfunction.1abc23def19.private.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
        ```
        {: screen}
