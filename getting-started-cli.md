# Getting started with the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI 
{: #cecli-getstart}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} API to create and manage your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} entities. 
{: shortdesc}


- [Set up your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI environment](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-install-cli).
- [Create and work with a project](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project).


## Setting up your CLI environment 
{: #cecli-getstart-setup}

To work with the CLI to create and manage {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} entities, set up your CLI environment. Make sure you have the latest version of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI installed.

Before you begin

You must create an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}.


1. Download and install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started). 

2. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI.

    1. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI.

        ```txt
        ibmcloud login
        ```
        {: pre}
        
    2. If you have more than one account, you are prompted to select which account to use. Follow the prompts or use the **`target`** command to select your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

        ```txt
        ibmcloud target -c <account_id>
        ```
        {: pre}

    3. Specify a region. Use the **`target`** command to target or change regions.

        ```txt
        ibmcloud target -r <region>
        ```
        {: pre}

    4. Specify a resource group. To get a list of your resource groups, run the following command.

        ```txt
        ibmcloud resource groups
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output

        ```txt
        Retrieving all resource groups under account <account_name> as email@ibm.com...
        OK
        Name      ID                                 Default Group   State   
        default   a8a12accd63b437bbd6d58fb8b462ca7   true            ACTIVE
        test      a8a12abbbd63b437cca6d58fb8b462ca7  false           ACTIVE
        ```
        {: screen}

    5. Target a resource group by running the following command.

        ```txt
        ibmcloud target -g <resource_group>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output

        ```txt 
        Targeted resource group default
        ```
        {: screen}


3. Install the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI plug-in. 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud plugin install code-engine
    ```
    {: pre}


4. Verify that the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI plug-in is installed. You can use the **`ibmcloud code-engine version`** command or the  **`ibmcloud plugin list`** command to confirm that the plug-in is installed.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud code-engine version
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    OK

    version:  v1.54.2
    commit:   e4800be63b1077563bdbaee9e656ce1f81c3e08d
    ```
    {: screen}


5. Run the **`ibmcloud ce help`** command to view the commands for the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI. For example, 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce help
    ```
    {: pre}


## Working with the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI 
{: #cecli-getstart-workcecli}

Now that your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI environment is set up, you are ready to work with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} resources, such as applications, functions, or jobs with the CLI. 

Before you can work with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} resources, you must work within the context of a project. 

A project is a grouping of {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} entities such as applications, jobs, and builds. A project is based on a Kubernetes namespace. The name of your project must be unique within your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} resource group, user account, and region. Projects are used to manage resources and provide access to its entities. 

A project provides the following items. 

- Provides a unique namespace for entity names.
- Manages access to project resources (inbound access).
- Manages access to backing services, registries, and repositories (outbound access).
- Has an automatically generated certificate for Transport Layer Service (TLS).

For more information about {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} projects, see [Managing projects](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project). 


1. Create a project with the [**`project create`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-create) command. Use a project name that is unique to your region. 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce project create --name PROJECT_NAME 
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Creating project 'myproject'...
    OK
    ```
    {: screen}

2. View details about the project with the [**`project get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-get) command. 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce project get --name PROJECT_NAME
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Getting project 'myproject'...
    OK
    Name:                       myproject
    ID:                         01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdabcd1111

Alternatively, you can use the [**`project list`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-list) command to display a list of your created projects. 

To work with a project with the CLI, the project must be selected as the current context. A project is automatically selected as the current context when it is created, unless you specify the `--no-select` option. To select a project that is not currently targeted, use the [**`project select`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-select) command.
