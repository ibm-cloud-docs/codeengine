# Updating a job
{: #update-job}

You can make changes to a defined job and run the updated job from the console or with the CLI. Changes to your job might include updating the code container image, code arguments or commands, runtime instance resources, or environment variables.
{: shortdesc}

Each time your job runs, the latest version of your referenced container image is used for the job run, unless a tag is specified for the image. If a tag is specified for the image, then the tagged image is used for the job run.

Submitted batch jobs are run in parallel, if possible. If the number or size of the submitted jobs exceeds the configured quota limits, such as maximum number of running instances, then {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} queues the jobs and delays running them until enough jobs finish. For more information about quotas and limits for jobs, including memory and CPU, see [Limits and quotas for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-limits).

You can [update your job](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-update-job) and its referenced code in *any* of the following ways, independent of how you created or previously updated your job.


- If you have a container image, per the [Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard](https://opencontainers.org/){: external}, then you need to provide only a reference to the image, which points to the location of your container registry when you create (or update) your job. You can create (or update) your job from images in a [public registry](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-create-job) or [private registry](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-create-job-private) and then access the referenced image from your job run.


    If you created your job by using the **`job create`** command and you specified the `--build-source` option to build the container image from local or repository source, and you want to change your job to point to a different container image, you must first remove the association of the build from your job. For example, run `ibmcloud ce job update -n JOB_NAME --build-clear`. After you remove the association of the build from your job, you can update the job to reference a different image. 
    {: important}

- If you are starting with source code that resides in a Git repository, you can choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} take care of building the image from your source and creating (or updating) the job with a **single** operation. In this scenario, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uploads your image to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}. To learn more, see [Creating a job from repository source code](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-run-job-source-code). If you want more control over the build of your image, then you can choose to [build the image](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build) with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} before you create (or update) your job and run the job.  

- If you are starting with source code that resides on a local workstation, you can choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} take care of building the image from your source and creating the job with a **single** CLI command. In this scenario, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uploads your image to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}. To learn more, see [Creating your job from local source code with the CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-job-local-source-code). If you want more control over the build of your image, then you can choose to [build the image](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build) with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} before you create (or update) your job and run the job.

For example, you might choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} handle the build of your local source while you evolve the development of your source for the job. Then, after the image is matured, you can update the job to reference the specific image that you want. You can repeat this process as needed.

When you run your updated job, the latest version of your referenced container image is used for the job run, unless a tag is specified for the image. If a tag is specified for the image, then the tagged image is used for the job run. 




## Updating a job from the console
{: #update-job-ui}

When a job is in ready state, you can update the job. Let's update the `myjob` job that you created previously to change the greeting and environment variables output by updating an environment variable. When a request is sent to this `icr.io/codeengine/helloworld` sample job, the job reads the environment variable `TARGET` and prints `"Hello ${TARGET}!"`. If this environment variable is empty, `"Hello World!"` is returned. For more information about the code that is used for this example, see [`helloworld`](https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine/tree/main/helloworld){: external}.

1. Navigate to your job page.
    * From the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}, click the name of your project. Click **Jobs** to work with your jobs and job runs.
    * From the Jobs page, click the **Jobs** tab, and click the name of the job that you want to update.

2. From the **Configuration > Environment variables** tab, click **Add environment variable**. Add a literal environment variable with the name of `TARGET` with a value of `Sunshine`. The `icr.io/codeengine/helloworld` outputs the message, `Hello <value_of_TARGET>!>`.
3. Click **Add** to add your environment variable.
4. Click **Deploy**.
5. Click **Submit job**.
6. From the Submit job pane, this time change the CPU value to one of the valid CPU choices for the specified memory. Notice that you must use [valid memory and CPU combinations](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-mem-cpu-combo). Click **Submit job** again to run this job. The system displays the status of your job on the Job details page. Notice the updated CPU value in the `Configuration` section of the job details.
19. By [viewing job logs from the console](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-logging&interface=ui#view-appjobfunctionlogs-ui) for this job, the output of the updated job is `Hello Sunshine!`.

## Updating a job with the CLI
{: #update-job-cli}

With the CLI, you can update an existing job configuration or specify your changes on a new job run.

### Updating a job configuration with the CLI
{: #update-jobconfig-cli}

You can update an existing job configuration with the [**`ibmcloud ce job update`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-job-update) command.

1. Use the **`job update`** command to update the `myjob` job to reference a different image.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce job update --name myjob --image icr.io/codeengine/testjob
    ```
    {: pre}

    Run the `ibmcloud ce job get -n myjob` command to display details of the updated job.

    Example output

    ```txt
    Name:          myjob
    ID:            abcdefgh-abcd-abcd-abcd-1a2b3c4d5e6f

    Project ID:    01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdabcd1111
    Age:           3m6s
    Created:       2021-06-04T11:56:22-04:00

    Last Job Run:

        Max Execution Time:    7200
        Retry Limit:           3
    [...]
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Run the [**`ibmcloud ce jobrun submit`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-jobrun-submit) command to run a job that references this updated job configuration. For the **`jobrun submit`** command, use the `--job` option to reference a defined job configuration. While the `--name` option is not required if the `--job` option is specified, the following example command specifies the `--name` option to provide a name for this job run.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce jobrun submit --name myjobrun1 --job myjob
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Run **`ibmcloud ce jobrun get -n myjobrun1`** to view details of this job run. Note that the referenced image is `icr.io/codeengine/testjob`, which is based on the updated job configuration.

    Example output

    ```txt

### Updating a job run with the CLI
{: #update-jobrun-cli}

You can specify changes for a job run with the [**`ibmcloud ce jobrun resubmit`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-job-update) command. The **`jobrun submit`** command resubmits a job run that references a previous job run.

1. Use the **`jobrun resubmit`** command to resubmit the `myjobrun1` job run and change the array indices from `0` to `1-4`. While the `--name` option is not required for the **`jobrun resubmit`** command, the following example command specifies the `--name` option to provide a name for this job run.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce jobrun resubmit -jobrun myjobrun1 --array-indices "1-4" --name myjobrunresubmit
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Run the `ibmcloud ce jobrun get -n myjobrunresubmit` command to display details of the updated job run. Note that the value of array indices is updated for this job run.

    Example output

    ```txt
    Getting jobrun 'myjobrunresubmit'...
    Getting instances of jobrun 'myjobrunresubmit'...
    Getting events of jobrun 'myjobrunresubmit'...
    [...]
