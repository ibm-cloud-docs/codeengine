# Why does my app connection fail when using a proxy?
{: #ts-app-connection-failwithproxy}
{: troubleshoot}

Your application connects to another service with a proxy such as [{{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}} (CIS)](/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started), which is based on CloudFlare. When your app runs, you notice that the connection ends unexpectedly, and you receive an `ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` message. 
{: tsSymptoms}



If you use {{site.data.keyword.cis_short}} or Cloudflare as a proxy for your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} application, after 100 seconds, if Cloudflare does not detect an HTTP response, the connection is closed and a 524 error is given by the proxy.
{: tsCauses}


To resolve this situation, make sure that your code responds to the proxy within 100 seconds, or increase the timeout value.
{: tsResolve}
