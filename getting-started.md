# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}}
{: #getting-started}

{{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} is a fully managed, serverless platform that runs your containerized workloads, including web apps, micro-services, event-driven functions, or batch jobs. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} even builds container images for you from your source code. All these workloads can seamlessly work together because they are all hosted within the same Kubernetes infrastructure. The {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} experience is designed so that you can focus on writing code and not on the infrastructure that is needed to host it.Â

First, learn about some [key terms](#term-summary) for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} and then get started with one of the following options.

- [Deploy an application](#app-hello)
- [Create and run a job](#first-job)
- [Run function code](#first-function)
- [Building your first container image from source code](#build-image-gs)

## What are {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} projects, applications, jobs, functions and fleets?
{: #term-summary}

Before you get started, become familiar with some key terms for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}. Afterward, you can test your knowledge and [take a quiz!](https://ibm.biz/BdfFxR){: external}

| Term | Description |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Project | A project is a grouping of {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} entities such as applications, jobs, and builds. Projects are used to manage resources and provide access to its entities.|
| Application | An application, or app, runs your code to serve HTTP requests. An application has a URL for incoming requests. The number of running instances of an application are automatically scaled up or down (to zero) based on incoming workload. |
| Build | A build, or image build, is a mechanism that you can use to create a container image from your source code. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} supports building from a Dockerfile or Cloud Native Buildpacks. |
| Function | A function is a stateless code snippet that performs tasks in response to an HTTP request. |
| Job | A job runs one or more instances of your executable code in parallel. Unlike applications, which include an HTTP Server to handle incoming requests, jobs are designed to run one time and exit. |
| Fleet | A fleet, also caled a *serverless fleet* runs one or more instances of user code to complete a series of specified tasks. Fleets are designed to tackle large, compute-heavy work loads. Unlike jobs, fleets are single tenant, implement dynamic task queuing, and provide full control over the machine profile configuration. For more information, see [What is the difference between jobs and fleets?]()  |

## How do apps, jobs, functions, and fleets compare?
{: #ce-comp}

| Characteristic | Application | Job | Function | Fleet |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------ |
| Execution time (duration) | Long-running (10 minutes per request) | Long-running (up to 24 hours) | Short-running (2 minutes or less) | Long-running (minutes to weeks) |
| Startup latency | Medium | Scheduled start | Low  | Low |
| Termination | Run-continuously | Run-to-completion | Run-to-completion | Run-to-completion |
| Invocation | On request or permanently running | Scheduled | On request, instant | Scheduled |
| Programming Model | Container-based build and execution | Container-based build and execution | Language-specific source code files and dependency metadata | Container-based build and execution |
| Parallelism | Parallel execution, flexible | Low to medium parallel execution | High parallel execution | High parallel execution and queuing |
| Scale-out | Based on number of requests | Based on job workload definition | Based on events or direct invocations | Based on number of tasks and concurrent instances |
| Optimized for | Long running, highly complex workload and on-demand scale-out | Scheduled or planned workloads with high resource demands | Startup time and rapid scale-out | Large, compute-intensive work loads |
