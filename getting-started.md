# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}}
{: #getting-started}

{{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} is a fully managed, serverless platform that runs your containerized workloads, including web apps, micro-services, event-driven functions, or batch jobs. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} even builds container images for you from your source code. All these workloads can seamlessly work together because they are all hosted within the same Kubernetes infrastructure. The {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} experience is designed so that you can focus on writing code and not on the infrastructure that is needed to host it.Â

First, learn about some [key terms](#term-summary) for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} and then get started with one of the following options.

- [Deploy an application](#app-hello)
- [Create and run a job](#first-job)
- [Run function code](#first-function)
- [Building your first container image from source code](#build-image-gs)


## What are {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} projects, applications, jobs, and functions?
{: #term-summary}

Before you get started, become familiar with some key terms for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}. Afterward, you can test your knowledge and [take a quiz!](https://ibm.biz/BdfFxR){: external}

| Term | Description |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Project | A project is a grouping of {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} entities such as applications, jobs, and builds. Projects are used to manage resources and provide access to its entities.|
| Application | An application, or app, runs your code to serve HTTP requests. An application has a URL for incoming requests. The number of running instances of an application are automatically scaled up or down (to zero) based on incoming workload. |
| Build | A build, or image build, is a mechanism that you can use to create a container image from your source code. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} supports building from a Dockerfile or Cloud Native Buildpacks. |
| Function | A function is a stateless code snippet that performs tasks in response to an HTTP request. |
| Job | A job runs one or more instances of your executable code in parallel. Unlike applications, which include an HTTP Server to handle incoming requests, jobs are designed to run one time and exit. |

Create your first {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app by using the `icr.io/codeengine/helloworld` image.
{: shortdesc}

1. Open the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview){: external} console.
2. Select **Let's go**.
3. Select a project from the list of available projects. You can also [create a new one](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project#create-a-project). Note that you must have a selected project to deploy an app.
4. Select **Application**.
5. Enter a name for the application, for example, `myapp`. Use a name for your application that is unique within the project.
6. Select to run a **Container image** and specify `icr.io/codeengine/helloworld` for the image reference. For this example, you do not need to modify the default values. For more information about the code that is used for this example, see [`helloworld`](https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine/tree/main/helloworld){: external}.
