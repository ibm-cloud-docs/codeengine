# Binding a service instance to an app, job, or function workload
{: #bind-services}

You can integrate an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instance to resources in an {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} project by using service bindings.
{: shortdesc}

After determining the service instance that you want to bind to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} workload, and ensuring that you have configured [access for service bindings](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-configure-bindaccess), you are ready to bind the service instance to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app, job, or function workload. 

Before you begin

* [Create a project](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project).
* Create a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} workload to bind to your service instance. The workload that you want to bind to the service instance must exist.
    * [Create an app](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app&interface=ui#deploy-app-console)
    * [Create a job](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-create-job#create-job-ui)
    * [Create a function](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-create-inlinecode)
* Create the service instance that you want to bind to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} workload.
* [Configure access for service bindings](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-configure-bindaccess).

Access for service bindings must be configured before you can bind a service instance to a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app, job, or function workload. [Configure access for service bindings](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-configure-bindaccess) based on whether you want {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} to automatically create and manage the service ID for you or whether you want to use a service ID that you manage. 
{: important}

When you work with service bindings, what is the relationship between the service ID, service access secrets, and service credentials?
:    In {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}, a *service binding* is the relationship between an app, job, or function workload and another {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uses a *service ID* to create credentials for a specific {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instance. These credentials are *service credentials* and are used by your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project to interact with the service instance. Service credentials are stored in a *service access secret*. A service access secret can be accessed by an app, job, or function with the service credentials and is used to interact with the service instance.

:   When you create your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instance, you can choose to create the service credential for that service instance. Or, when you create a service binding, you can choose for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} to automatically create the service instance credential for you if you configured [access for service bindings](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-configure-bindaccess).

:   Whether you choose for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} to automatically create the service credential for you or you manually create the service credential for a specific service instance, you must specify the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for the service credential. The role that you specify defines the interaction that is allowed with the specific service instance and the bound {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app, job, or function. For example, if you create a service binding from {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} to an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant}} service instance and you  want the app, job, or function only to read from the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant}} database, select the `Reader` role. 


## Binding a service instance to a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job from the console 
{: #bind-ui}

You can create a service binding that binds an existing service instance to a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job by using the console. To create a service binding for a function, you must [use the CLI](#bind-cli).

### Binding a service instance with a new service access secret (with a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} autogenerated credential) 
{: #bind-credential-ui-newsecret-autocred}

Let's create a service binding to bind a service instance to an app or job with a new service access secret that uses a service credential that is automatically generated by {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}. For this example, create a service binding from the console for the `myapp` app and choose for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} to automatically create the service credential to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instance. Before {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} can automatically create the service credential, ensure that you [configure access for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} to automatically create and manage the service ID for service bindings](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-configure-bindaccess#bind-auto-servid-access).

1. After your project is in **Active** status, click the name of your project on the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}.
2. From the Overview page, click **Service bindings**.
3. From the Service bindings page, click **Create** to create the binding.
4. Select the IBM service instance that you want to bind to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job.
5. Select the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job that you want to bind to the service instance; for example, choose the `myapp` app.
6. Specify the service access secret to use with this binding. The service access secret stores the credential for the service binding. Notice that any previously defined service credential for your specific service instance, which is not associated with the app or job that you selected, is listed. If no service access secret currently exists, then you are creating a new secret. If a service access secret does exist, to create a new service access secret with a new service credential for this binding, select **New secret**. Complete the following steps.
    1. Select the **Role** for the service instance credential.
    2. Expand **Advanced options**.
    3. For {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} to automatically create the service credential to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instance, select `Auto-generate`.
    4. (optional) Specify a custom prefix for the service binding. If you do not specify a custom prefix, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically generates a prefix. The prefix is used to distinguish environment variables that are created for this service binding.
7. Click **Add** to create the service binding.
8. Now that your service binding to your app or job is created from the console, you can view a list of all defined service bindings between service instances and {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} apps and jobs from the Service bindings page.

Alternatively, you can also create and manage service bindings to specific apps and jobs from the specific {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job page in the console. To work with service bindings within the context of your app or job, go to the **Service bindings** tab for your specific app or job.
{: important}


### Binding a service instance with a new service access secret (with an existing credential)
{: #bind-credential-ui-newsecret-existingcred}

Suppose you want to create a service binding to bind a service instance to an app or job with a new service access secret that uses an existing service credential. The existing service credential might have been automatically generated by {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}, or the service credential might have been manually. For this example, create a service binding for the `myjob` job, with a new service access secret that uses an existing service credential. 

1. After your project is in **Active** status, click the name of your project on the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}.
2. From the Overview page, click **Service bindings**.
3. From the Service bindings page, click **Create** to create the binding.
4. Select the IBM service instance that you want to bind to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job.
5. Select the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job that you want to bind to the service instance; for example, choose the `myjob` job. 
6. Specify the service access secret to use with this binding. The service access secret stores the credential for the service binding. Notice that any previously defined service credential for your specific service instance, which is not associated with the app or job that you selected, is listed. If no service access secret currently exists, then you are creating a new secret. If a service access secret does exist, to create a new service access secret with a new service credential for this binding, select **New secret**. Complete the following steps. 
    1. Select the **Role** for the service instance credential.
    2. Expand **Advanced options**.
    3. Select the service credential to use with this service access secret. 
    4. (optional) Specify a custom prefix for the service binding. If you do not specify a custom prefix, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically generates a prefix. The prefix is used to distinguish environment variables that are created for this service binding.
7. Click **Add** to create the service binding.
8. Now that your service binding to your app or job is created from the console, you can view a list of all defined service bindings between service instances and {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} apps and jobs from the Service bindings page.

Alternatively, you can also create and manage service bindings to specific apps and jobs from the specific {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job page in the console. To work with service bindings within the context of your app or job, go to the **Service bindings** tab for your specific app or job.
{: important}

### Binding a service instance with an existing service access secret
{: #bind-credential-ui-existingsecret}

You can reuse service access secrets in service bindings. For a specific {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instance, you can reuse service access secrets with different apps or jobs. You cannot reuse a service access secret for the same app or job that the service access secret was originally created for. Since the service credential is stored within the service access secret, it is important to consider the following points:

* You can have more than one app or job that is bound to the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instance with the same service access secret.

* A service access secret cannot be reused in a service binding for the same app or job. However, you can reuse the same service access secret in a different app or job. Because a service access secret is associated with a specific {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instance, you can reuse only the service access secret in a different app or job, if you are binding to the same service instance.

Let's create a service binding to bind a service instance to a job that uses an existing service access secret. For example, create a service binding for the `myjob` job and choose an existing service access secret for a specific service instance.

1. After your project is in **Active** status, click the name of your project on the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}.
2. From the Overview page, click **Service bindings**.
3. From the Service bindings page, click **Create** to create the binding.
4. Select the IBM service instance that you want to bind to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job.
5. Select the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job that you want to bind to the service instance.
6. You can reuse an existing credential for the service access secret for a service binding to a specific {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instance with a different app or job. For this case, select **Existing secret**. Notice that any previously defined service credential for your specific service instance is listed, which is not associated with the app or job that you selected. Complete the following steps.
    1. Review the list of existing secrets and select the secret that you want to use with this service binding.
    2. (optional) Specify a custom prefix for the service binding. If you do not specify a custom prefix, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically generates a prefix. The prefix is used to distinguish environment variables that are created for this service binding.
7. Click **Add** to create the service binding.
8. Now that your service binding to your app or job is created from the console, you can view a list of all defined service bindings between service instances and {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} apps and jobs from the Service bindings page.

Alternatively, you can also create and manage service bindings to specific apps and jobs from the specific {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app or job page in the console. To work with service bindings within the context of your app or job, go to the **Service bindings** tab for your specific app or job.

## Binding a service instance to a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app, job, or function with the CLI
{: #bind-cli}

You can create a service binding that binds an existing service instance to a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app, job, or function with the CLI. 

Before you begin

* [Create and work with a project](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project).
* Set up your [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-install-cli) environment.
* Create the service instance that you want to bind to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} workload.

    For example, to create an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance (Lite plan):

    ```txt
    ibmcloud resource service-instance-create my-object-storage cloud-object-storage lite global -g Default
    ```
    {: pre}

* Create a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} workload. 

### Binding a service instance with a new credential
{: #bind-credentials}


- To bind your new service instance to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app and generate a new service credential, use the [**`ibmcloud ce application bind`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-bind) command. 
- To bind your service instance to a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job, use the [**`ibmcloud ce job bind`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-job-bind) command. 
- To bind your service instance to a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} function, use the [**`ibmcloud ce function bind`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-function-bind) command. 

To create an app to use for these steps, run the following command.

```txt
ibmcloud ce application create --name my-application --image icr.io/codeengine/hello
```
{: pre}

1. Identify the name of the service instance that you want to bind to your app, job, or function. You can find all the service instances that are in your account for your current resource group by running the **`ibmcloud resource service-instances`** command; for example,

    ```txt
    ibmcloud resource service-instances
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Name                               Location   State    Type               Resource Group ID

    ```
    {: screen}

2. Bind your service instance to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app, job, or function and generate a new service credential with the default service role. The default service role is either Manager or the first role that is provided by the service if Manager is not supported. In the following example, **`application bind`** command binds the `my-object-storage` service instance with the app called `my-application`. A new service credential with the Manager role is generated for this binding action.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce application bind --name my-application --service-instance my-object-storage
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following table summarizes the options that are used with the **`application bind`** command in this example. For more information about the command and its options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce application bind`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-bind) command.

    | Option | Description |
    | --- | --- |

### Binding a service instance with a specific role
{: #bind-credentials-role}


- To bind your new service instance to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app and generate a new service credential, use the [**`ibmcloud ce application bind`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-bind) command. 
- To bind your service instance to a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job, use the [**`ibmcloud ce job bind`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-job-bind) command. 
- To bind your service instance to a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} function, use the [**`ibmcloud ce function bind`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-function-bind) command. 

To create a function to use for these steps, run the following command.

```txt
ibmcloud ce function create --name myfun --runtime nodejs-20 --build-source https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine --build-context-dir /helloworld-samples/function-nodejs
```
{: pre}

1. Identify the name of the service instance that you want to bind to your app, job, or function. You can find all the service instances that are in your account for your current resource group by running the **`ibmcloud resource service-instances`** command; for example, 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud resource service-instances
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Name                               Location   State    Type               Resource Group ID

    ```
    {: screen}

2. Bind your service instance to your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} app, job, or function and generate a new service credential with a specific service role. For more information about IAM service roles, see [Service access roles](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles#service_access_roles). In the following example, the  **`function bind`** command binds the `my-object-storage` service instance to the function called `my-function` by using the Writer service role. A new service credential with the Writer role is generated for this binding action. By specifying the `--prefix` option, a prefix is added to the environment variables that are created by the service bindings.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce function bind --name my-function --service-instance my-object-storage --role Writer --prefix MYPREFIX
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following table summarizes the options that are used with the **`function bind`** command in this example. For more information about the command and its options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce function bind`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-function-bind) command.

### Binding a service instance with existing credentials
{: #bind-existing-credentials}

If you already created a credential for your service instance and want to use it for your service binding, add the `--service-credentials` option.

To create a job to use for these steps, run the following command.

```txt
ibmcloud ce job create --name my-job --image icr.io/codeengine/hello
```
{: pre}

1. Identify the name of the service instance that you want to bind to your app, job, or function. You can find all the service instances that are in your account for your current resource group by running the **`ibmcloud resource service-instances`** command; for example, 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud resource service-instances
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Name                               Location   State    Type               Resource Group ID
    my-object-storage                  global     active   service_instance   325d80be5d7945608f6d121712c96ee9
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Find the credentials of the service instance.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud resource service-keys --instance-name INSTANCENAME
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Name                State    Created At       
    my-cos-credential   active   Tue Mar  2 01:15:33 UTC 2021
    ```
    {: screen}

    To see details of a service credential, run `ibmcloud resource service-key KEYNAME`. You can find all the service keys in your resource group by running `ibmcloud resource service-keys`.
    {: tip}

3. Bind the service instance to the app, job or function with existing credentials. For example, the following **`job bind`** command binds the `my-object-storage` service instance with existing service credentials called `my-cos-credential` to an existing job that is called `myjob`.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce job bind --name myjob --service-instance my-object-storage --service-credential my-cos-credential
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following table summarizes the options that are used with the **`job bind`** command in this example. For more information about the command and its options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce job bind`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-job-bind) command.

## Unbinding service instances
{: #unbind}

Unbinding service instances from an app, job, or function workloads removes existing service bindings.

When you unbind (or remove) a service binding, you are deleting the association of the app, job, or function workload with the service access secret such that the workload no longer has access to previously bound {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service. 

After a service binding is defined between your application and a service instance, the service binding is active as long as the application and the service instance is active, or you haven't completed an unbind operation to remove the service binding. If the service instance is deleted, you'll need to manually delete the service binding. 

### Unbinding a service instance from the console
{: #unbind-ui}



1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}, go to your project.
2. From the Overview page, click **Service bindings** to view a listing of all defined service bindings. Or, if you want to manage service bindings from the context of your app or job, from the Overview page, click **Applications** or **Jobs** and click the name of your app or job.  From the specific app or job page, go to the **Service bindings** tab. 
3. From the list of service bindings, delete the binding that you want to remove from your app or job. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") > **Delete** to delete the service binding. 



### Unbinding a service instance with the CLI
{: #unbind-cli}

1. Find the service binding that you want to remove with the **`application get`**, **`job get`**, or the **`function get`** command; for example, 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce application get --name my-application
    ```
    {: pre}

    Service Bindings:
    Name                                         ID                                    Service Instance      Service Type          Role / Credential  Environment Variable Prefix

    {: screen}

2. Remove the service binding by using the **`application unbind`**, **`job unbind`**, or **`function unbind`** command.

    * To remove a single binding, specify the `--name` and `--binding` options. 

        ```txt
        ibmcloud ce application unbind --name APPLICATION_NAME --binding BINDING_NAME
        ```
        {: pre}

    * To unbind all service instances, use the `--all` option.

        ```txt
        ibmcloud ce job unbind --name JOB_NAME --all
        ```
        {: pre}
