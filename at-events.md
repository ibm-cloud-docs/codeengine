# Auditing events for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}
{: #at_events}

You can view, manage, and audit user-initiated activities made in your {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} service instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} service.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to follow regulatory audit requirements. You can also be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected follow the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [Getting Started with {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-getting-started).

You can also start auditing from your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} dashboard by selecting **Add auditing**.

Note:
- The update event does not include the original value; it includes only the new value that is provided in request body. To find the original value, you can run read action before you run the update action.
- The `requestData` field includes request body and verb of action.
- The `responseData` field includes response body of action.
- For some actions, for example `codeengine.pods.list` or `codeengine.pods.get` actions, the event length might exceed 16 K. If this event length occurs,  the `responseData` field is set to `Information about the action is not included for performance and size reasons.`

## Viewing events
{: #view}

{{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}} sends audit logs to the [{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-getting-started) service in the same region as the {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}} project. For example, audit logs in an {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}} project in `us-south` are sent to a logging instance in `us-south`. For more information about setting up {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, see [Provisioning an instance](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-instance-provision&interface=ui).

## Analyzing events
{: #at_events_analyze}

After you view events that are captured by {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}, you can then analyze the events.
{: shortdesc}

Identifying the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project that generates the event
:    To identify the project for which the event was generated, look at the `target.id` field. You can use this field to filter events in {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort_notm}}, for example, showing events for only a specific project.
:    You can use the CLI to find details about your [project](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project).

Getting the unique ID of a request
:    Each action that you perform on a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project resource has a unique ID.
:    To find the unique ID of a request, look at the `correlationId` value that is set in the `correlationId` field.

Getting information for failures
:    All events that are issued for failed actions display `failure` in the `outcome` field, and in addition provide more details as part of the `reason` field. Note that the `reason.reasonForFailure` field might be especially helpful, as it contains details of the failure.

Custom views
:    For more information about generating custom views by using event fields, see [Managing custom views in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-custom_views&interface=ui).
