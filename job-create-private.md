# Creating a job from images in a private registry
{: #create-job-private}

Create your job that uses an image in a private registry such as private Docker Hub. You can create a job from the console or with the CLI. 
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin

* To pull images from a private registry, you must first create a private registry. For example, to create a private Docker Hub registry, see [Docker Hub documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/){: external}. 
* After you create a private registry, [push an image to it](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#pushing-a-docker-container-image-to-docker-hub){: external}. 
* You can also set up an access token. By using an access token, you can more easily grant and revoke access to your Docker Hub account without requiring a password change. For more information about access tokens and Docker Hub, see [Create and manage access tokens](https://docs.docker.com/security/access-tokens/){: external}.

## Creating a job that references an image in a private registry with the console
{: #create-job-private-console}

Create a job configuration that uses an image in a private registry with the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} console.
{: shortdesc}

Before you can work with a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job that references an image in a private registry, you must first add access to the registry so {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} can pull the image when the job is run. 

1. Open the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview){: external} console.
2. Select **Let's go**.
3. Select **Job**.
4. Enter a name for the job; for example, `myjob`.
5. Select a project from the list of available projects. You can also [create a new one](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project#create-a-project). Note that you must have a selected project to create a job.
6. Select **Container image** and click **Configure image**.
7. Enter `docker.io` for **Registry server**.
8. For **Registry secret**, select **Create registry secret**. 
9. From the Create registry secret page, choose your registry source. For example, **Docker Hub**.
10. From the Create registry secret page, enter a username. For Docker Hub, it is your Docker ID.
11. From the Create registry secret page, enter the password. For Docker Hub, you can use your Docker Hub password or an access token. For more information about access tokens and Docker Hub, see [Create and manage access tokens](https://docs.docker.com/security/access-tokens/){: external}.
12. Click **Create** to add the registry secret for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}.
13. From the Configure image page, the registry secret that was added is listed. Select the registry secret for your image.
14. Select the namespace and name of the image in Docker Hub for the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job to reference. For example, select `mynamespace` and select the image `testjob` in that namespace.
15. Select a value for **Tag**; for example, `latest`.
16. Click **Done**. You selected your image in the registry to reference from your job.
17. Modify any default values for environment variables or runtime settings. For more information about these options, see [Options for creating and running a job](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-job-plan#job-options).
18. From the Create job page, click **Create**.
19. After your job is created, the job page for your specific job opens. From your job page, click **Submit job** to submit a job based on the current configuration.

To add registry access *before* you create a job configuration, see [Accessing container registries](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-add-registry). 

## Creating a job with an image from a private registry with CLI
{: #create-job-private-cli}

To create a job configuration with an image from a private registry with CLI, use the **`job create`** command. This command requires a name and an image and also allows other optional arguments. For a complete listing of options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce job create`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-job-create) command.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin

* Set up your [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-install-cli) environment.
* [Create and work with a project](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project).
* Before you can work with a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job that references an image in a private registry, you must first add access to the registry, pull the image, and then create your job configuration.

1. To pull images from a private registry, you must first create a private registry. For example, to create a private Docker Hub registry, see [Docker Hub documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/){: external}. After you create a private registry, [push an image to it](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#pushing-a-docker-container-image-to-docker-hub){: external}. You can also set up an access token. By using an access token, you can more easily grant and revoke access to your Docker Hub account without requiring a password change. For more information about access tokens and Docker Hub, see [Create and manage access tokens](https://docs.docker.com/security/access-tokens/){: external}.

2. Add access to your private registry to pull images. To add access to a private registry with the CLI, use the [**`ibmcloud ce secret create --format registry`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-secret-create) command to create an registry secret. For example, the following command creates registry access to a Docker Hub registry called `privatedocker` that is at ``https://index.docker.io/v1/`` and uses your username and password.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce secret create --format registry --name privatedocker --server https://index.docker.io/v1/ --username <Docker_User_Name> --password <Password>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Creating registry secret 'privatedocker'...
    OK
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Create your job configuration and reference the image in your private Docker Hub registry. For example, create the `mytestjob` job configuration to reference the `docker.io/privaterepo/testjob` by using the `privatedocker` access information. 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce job create --name mytestjob --image docker.io/privaterepo/testjob --registry-secret privatedocker
    ```
    {: pre}

The format of the name of the image for this job is `REGISTRY/NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY:TAG` where `REGISTRY` and `TAG` are optional. If `REGISTRY` is not specified, the default is `docker.io`. If `TAG` is not specified, the default is `latest`.

## Next steps
{: #nextsteps-jobcreatepriv}

* After you create your job, submit the job to run it. See [Run a job](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-run-job). You can run your job multiple times. 

* After you [run your job](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-run-job), to view details of your job and job runs, see [access job details](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-access-job-details).

* Now that your job is created, consider making your jobs event-driven. By using event subscriptions, you can trigger your jobs by [periodic schedules](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-subscribe-cron#eventing-cron-job) or set your job to react to events like [file uploads](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-eventing-cosevent-producer#obstorage_ev_job).

* You can [update your job](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-update-job) and its referenced code in *any* of the following ways, independent of how you created or previously updated your job.

    - If you have a container image, per the [Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard](https://opencontainers.org/){: external}, then you need to provide only a reference to the image, which points to the location of your container registry when you create (or update) your job. You can create (or update) your job from images in a [public registry](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-create-job) or [private registry](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-create-job-private) and then access the referenced image from your job run.

        If you created your job by using the **`job create`** command and you specified the `--build-source` option to build the container image from local or repository source, and you want to change your job to point to a different container image, you must first remove the association of the build from your job. For example, run `ibmcloud ce job update -n JOB_NAME --build-clear`. After you remove the association of the build from your job, you can update the job to reference a different image.

    - If you are starting with source code that resides in a Git repository, you can choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} take care of building the image from your source and creating (or updating) the job with a **single** operation. In this scenario, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uploads your image to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}. To learn more, see [Creating a job from repository source code](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-run-job-source-code). If you want more control over the build of your image, then you can choose to [build the image](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build) with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} before you create (or update) your job and run the job.  

    - If you are starting with source code that resides on a local workstation, you can choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} take care of building the image from your source and creating the job with a **single** CLI command. In this scenario, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uploads your image to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}. To learn more, see [Creating your job from local source code with the CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-job-local-source-code). If you want more control over the build of your image, then you can choose to [build the image](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build)) with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} before you create (or update) your job and run the job.

    For example, you might choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} handle the build of your local source while you evolve the development of your source for the job. Then, after the image is matured, you can update the job to reference the specific image that you want. You can repeat this process as needed.

    When you run your updated job, the latest version of your referenced container image is used for the job run, unless a tag is specified for the image. If a tag is specified for the image, then the tagged image is used for the job run.
