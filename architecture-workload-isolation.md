# Learning about {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} architecture and workload isolation
{: #architecture}

{{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} is the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform that unifies container images, 12-factor-apps, functions, and batch jobs as a one-stop-shop. It's a multi-tenant system that consists of three major building blocks: A control plane, a (set of) shard (or shards), and a routing layer. The control plane and the shards are realized as separate multi-zone Kubernetes clusters. The following diagram gives a graphical overview of the architecture.

![Code Engine architecture diagram](images/codeengine-architecture.svg "Code Engine architecture diagram"){: caption="Code Engine architecture diagram" caption-side="bottom"}

{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} is based on {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters and depends on the components and workload isolation of the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} VPC cluster architecture](/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch#architecture_vpc).

All components are managed and owned by IBM and run in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. Each cluster is running in its own VPC and separated from other clusters.

The {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} control plane runs the components that are shared among all {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} users and make the Kubernetes cluster a true multi-tenant system. The control-plane consists of four microservices that are deployed on it.

| Component | Purpose |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| Resource broker |    Creates and deletes {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project resources in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource controller and requests the placement of the project on a shard. |
| Project placement controller | Selects a shard and requests the creation, deletion, and isolation of the project on the shard. |
| API server |    Provides the target information (`KUBECONFIG` file) for the selected project. It also performs IAM access policy checks and writes audit records. |
| `Kube API proxy` | Proxies each API request to the proper shard cluster, perform IAM policy checks, and writes audit records. |

The shards are running the customer workload, such as builds, batch jobs, or apps. Therefore, the shard cluster runs the following microservices to control the customer workloads.

| Component | Purpose |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| Project isolation controller | Manages and isolates the Kubernetes namespace corresponding to the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project resource. It monitors and ensures the isolation aspects like role-based-access-control (RBAC), pod security policies, resource quota, and network policies are enforced.  |
| Project domain and cert controller |  Manages the domain and certificates for the route endpoint of the project. The endpoint consists of a DNS entry and a wildcard certificate. |
| Knative and Istio |  Manage the lifecycle of applications. Knative is responsible for scaling the application. Istio is responsible for routing the traffic to the proper revision and container of the application. |
| Batch controller | Manages the lifecycle and containers for jobs and job runs.  |
| Build controller |  Manages the lifecycle and containers for builds and build runs. |
| Service binding and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} operator | Manage the lifecycle of secrets that are associated to bindings of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services to applications and jobs. |
| {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} event source controller | Manage the lifecycle of event subscriptions from the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service. |
| Cluster node autoscaler | Scales the shard by adding and removing worker nodes based on capacity demand.  |
| {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} | Sends service metrics to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}. For more information about these metrics, see [Monitoring for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-monitor).|
| {{site.data.keyword.logs_full}} | Forward platform logs and metrics to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}. For more information, see [Auditing events for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-at_events). |

## {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} workload isolation
{: #workload-isolation}

{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} is a multi-tenant, regional service where tenants share the same network and compute infrastructure. In particular, the network and compute infrastructure are shared resources and some management components are common to all tenants. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} implements the following controls to separate tenants:

- {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project resources are separated within a secured Kubernetes environment that is running in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} multi-zone region.
- {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} projects and its containing resources, such as application, builds, and jobs that run on shared clusters that use shared management components.
- To separate the access to project resources, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} performs several levels of authentication and authorization checks within the `apiserver` and `kube-api-proxy` components (see previous table),
    - IAM authentication and access policies checks are performed on a project level.
    - To manage multi-tenant access to the underlying Kubernetes API, direct access to the API server is not allowed. Instead, use the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} custom `Kube-api-proxy` API for access.
    - Role-based access control checks are performed on a resource level to allow only authorized users to perform certain operations on project resources.
- The authorization is controlled by the customer by assigning `manager`, `reader`, or `writer` roles to users for a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project resource within IAM.
- To restrict customer workload, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} enforces the following concepts,
    - Container isolation through various Linux isolation techniques. These techniques ensure multiple layers of security to prevent the privilege escalation of containers and to restrict containers to use a limited set of system privileges.
    - Resource quota and `LimitRange` to prevent excessive resource consumption.
    - Network policies to control the network flows within the environment.
- Shared multi-tenant components are secured, for example, by disabling reverse lookup in `KubeDNS`.
- To limit the blast radius, each shard cluster is running in its own VPC, which is isolated from other shard VPCs.
- DDoS protection is enabled automatically for all endpoints, including customer applications, through {{site.data.keyword.cis_short}} with no additional cost to you. DDoS protection covers System Interconnection (OSI) Layer 3 and Layer 4 (TCP/IP) protocol attacks, but not Layer 7 (HTTP) attacks. See [DDoS protection](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-secure#secure-ddos).
- If you require web application firewall rules, confiture your own {{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}} (CIS) instance or a third-party gateway service with a custom domain in front of your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} endpoints and enable a web application firewall (WAF) in this instance.
