# Debugging jobs
{: #troubleshoot-job}
{: troubleshoot}

Use the troubleshooting tips to learn how to troubleshoot {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} jobs and runs of your job.
{: shortdesc}

## Job limits to consider
{: #ts-job-limits}

The maximum number of jobs that you can have per project is 100. You are limited to a total of 100 job runs per project before you need to remove or clean up old ones.

For more information about limits for jobs including memory and CPU, see [Limits and quotas for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-limits).

With the CLI, you can use the [**`ibmcloud ce project get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-get) command to display information about limits and current usage. For example:

```txt
ibmcloud ce project create --name myproject
```
{: pre}

Example output

```txt
Getting project 'myproject'...

## Getting logs for my jobs
{: #ts-jobrun-gettinglogs}

Logs can be helpful to troubleshoot problems when you run jobs. You can view job logs from the console or with the CLI.
{: shortdesc}

When you view logs from the console, you must create an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance in the same region as your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project. You are not required to create this instance before you work with your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} makes it easy to enable logging for your jobs. You can view job logs after you add logging capabilities. For more information, see [viewing job logs from the console](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-logging&interface=ui#view-appjobfunctionlogs-ui).

When working with the CLI, you can display logs of all the instances of your running job or display logs of a specific instance of your job.

1. Use the [**`ibmcloud ce jobrun list`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-jobrun-list) command to list all your defined job runs; for example,

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce jobrun list
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Use the [**`ibmcloud ce jobrun get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-jobrun-get) command to get the details of your job run, including the name of the instances for the job run; for example,

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce jobrun get --name myjobrun
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Getting jobrun 'myjobrun'...
    Getting instances of jobrun 'myjobrun'...
    Getting events of jobrun 'myjobrun'...
    Run 'ibmcloud ce jobrun events -n myjobrun' to get the system events of the job run instances.
    Run 'ibmcloud ce jobrun logs -f -n myjobrun' to follow the logs of the job run instances.
    OK

    If you want more fine-grained details about your job run, use the `--o yaml` option with the **`jobrun get`** command; for example, `ibmcloud ce jobrun get --name myjobrun --o yaml`. This option is useful to show more detailed information in the CLI for the job run.
    {: tip}


3. Display the logs of instances of your job run.

    * To display the logs of a specific instance of your job run, use the [**`ibmcloud ce jobrun logs --instance INSTANCE_NAME`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-jobrun-logs) command; for example,

        ```txt
        ibmcloud ce jobrun logs --instance  myjobrun-4-0
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output

        myjobrun-4-0/myjobrun:
        Hi from a batch job! My index is: 4
        ```
        {: screen}

    * To display the logs of all the instances of your job run, use the [**`ibmcloud ce jobrun logs --jobrun JOBRUN_NAME`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-jobrun-logs) command; for example,

        ```txt
        ibmcloud ce jobrun logs --jobrun myjobrun
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output

        ```txt
        Getting logs for all instances of job run 'myjobrun'...
        Getting jobrun 'myjobrun'...
        Getting instances of jobrun 'myjobrun'...
        OK

## Getting system event information for my jobs
{: #ts-job-gettingevent}

System event information can be helpful to troubleshoot problems when you run jobs. You can view system event information with the CLI.
{: shortdesc}

You can display system events of all the instances of a job run or display system events of a specific instance of a job run.

## Understanding why job run indexes can fail
{: #ts-job-failure-messages}

When job run indexes fail in the console, you can look up the errors and reasoning to help troubleshoot problems, rectify the issues, and then rerun the job run indexes.

To work with your jobs and job runs, from the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview){: external} console, click the name of your project in the project list, and then click **Jobs**. From the **Jobs** tab, select a job. Click **Submit job**, and in the "Submit job" pane, click the **Submit job** button to see the job run instances. Incomplete job runs show as `Failed (<error>)` in the **Status** column. The following table explains the common job run index errors and actions to take:

| Error | Explanation | Suggested user action |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `ContainerExitedCode` | A user error, which includes an exit code that is provided by the user workload. | Determine the reason for the exit code within your application and debug it. |
| `ExceededEphemeralStorage` | The instance allocated more ephemeral storage within its container than is allowed. | Increase your resource's ephemeral storage. |
| `ExecutableNotFound` | Unable to find the specified executable file within the container. The container cannot start without it. | Verify that the entry point that is specified within your container image is correct, and that the executable exists within the image. |
| `MaxExecutionTimeExceeded` | The job run did not complete within the maximum execution time. If multiple instances were running, all instances that did not yet complete show this error. | Increase the job run timeout value. |
|  `OOMKilled` | An out of memory error. The instance exceeded the allocated memory limit. | Increase your resource's CPU and memory. |
{: caption="Error and reasons for failed job run indexes" caption-side="bottom"}

After you address the errors, click **Rerun failed indexes** to run the job again for indexes that failed.

## Verifying the container image reference for my job
{: #ts-jobrun-verifyimage}

When you work with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} jobs, you must specify a container image reference and a registry secret to access the image. For the job to work correctly, the image reference and its access properties must remain valid for the life of the job.

See [How can I verify my image reference](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-ts-build-verify-image)?
