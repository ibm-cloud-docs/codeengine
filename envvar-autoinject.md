# Automatically injected environment variables
{: #inside-env-vars}

When you deploy an application or a function, or when you run a job, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically injects certain environment variables into the application, function, or job.
{: shortdesc}

## Automatically injected environment variables for applications
{: #inside-env-vars-app}

When you deploy an application, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically injects certain environment variables into the application. The following table lists automatically injected environment variables into each instance of your deployed application. The following examples of automatically injected environment variables are based on an application that is named `myapp`, which references the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} sample image, `icr.io/codeengine/codeengine`.

The environment variables, `CE_APP`, `CE_DOMAIN`, and `CE_SUBDOMAIN` are used to construct the URL of an application, `https://CE_APP.CE_SUBDOMAIN.CE_DOMAIN`. For example, if `CE_APP=myapp`, `CE_SUBDOMAIN=01234567-abcd` and `CE_DOMAIN=us-south.codeengine.dev.appdomain.cloud`, your application external URL is `https://myapp.01234567-abcd.us-south.codeengine.dev.appdomain.cloud`. The private URL of your application is `appName.CE_SUBDOMAIN`, or `myapp.01234567-abcd`.

Note that you can override the `PORT` variable by deploying your application from the console and specifying the **Listening port** value or by using the CLI and setting the `--port` option.

## Automatically injected environment variables for functions
{: #inside-env-vars-fun}

When you deploy an function, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically injects certain environment variables into the function.  The following table lists automatically injected environment variables into each instance of your deployed function.

The environment variables, `CE_FUNCTION`, `CE_DOMAIN`, and `CE_SUBDOMAIN` are used to construct the URL of a function, `https://CE_FUNCTION.CE_SUBDOMAIN.CE_DOMAIN`. For example, if `CE_FUNCTION=myfunc`, `CE_SUBDOMAIN=01234567-abcd` and `CE_DOMAIN=us-south.codeengine.dev.appdomain.cloud`, your function external URL is `https://myfunc.01234567-abcd.us-south.codeengine.dev.appdomain.cloud`. The private URL of your application is `CE_FUNCTION.CE_SUBDOMAIN.private.CE_DOMAIN`, or `myfunc.01234567-abcd.private.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud`.

## Automatically injected environment variables for jobs
{: #inside-env-vars-jobs}

When you run a job, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically injects certain environment variables into the job run instance.

The following table lists automatically injected environment variables into each instance of your running job. The following examples of automatically injected environment variables are based on a job that is named `myjob`, which references the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} sample image, `icr.io/codeengine/codeengine`.

| Environment variable | Description | Example |
|----------------|---------------------|---------|
| `CE_API_BASE_URL`  | The private {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} API URL that is based on the region of the project. Use this URL for API endpoint calls to the endpoint for all components (including jobs) that are located in the same region of your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project.   | `CE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.private.us-south.codeengine.cloud.ibm.com` |
| `CE_DOMAIN`    | The domain name of the project.                                           | `CE_DOMAIN=us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud` |
| `CE_REGION`    | The region where the job run resides. | `CE_REGION=us-south` |
| `CE_PROJECT_ID` | The project ID of your project. | `CE_PROJECT_ID=abcdefgh-abcd-abcd-abcd-1a2b3c4d5e6f` |
| `CE_JOB`       | The name of the defined job configuration that was used for the job run.  | `CE_JOB=myjobdef` |

| `CE_SUBDOMAIN` | The subdomain associated with the project in which your job is running. If you are familiar with Kubernetes, `CE_SUBDOMAIN` maps to the Kubernetes namespace that is associated with your project.                       | `CE_SUBDOMAIN=01234567-abcd` |
| `HOME`         | Your home directory that is running the job.                              | `HOME=/root` |
| `HOSTNAME`     | The name of instance that your application is deployed to.                        | `HOSTNAME=myjob-jobrun-6bgmg-0-0` |
| `JOB_ARRAY_SIZE` | The number of job instances to run in parallel. The value is specified directly as the job run array size, or computed by counting the specified indices.  | `JOB_ARRAY_SIZE=10` |
| `JOB_INDEX`    | The index of a specific job run instance.                                 | `JOB_INDEX=1` |
| `JOB_INDEX_RETRY_COUNT` |  The current retry count of the job instance.                    | `JOB_INDEX_RETRY_COUNT=0` |
| `JOB_MODE`    | The mode for runs of a job. In `task` mode, jobs run for a maximum time and failed instances are retried per the job retries limit. In `daemon` mode, jobs run without a maximum time and failed instances are restarted indefinitely.  | `JOB_MODE=task` |
| `JOB_RETRY_LIMIT` | The configured retry limit of the jobrun.                              | `JOB_RETRY_LIMIT=3`
| `PATH`         | The list of directories in which the system looks for executables.        | `PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin` |
| `PWD`          | The current working directory.                                            | `PWD=/` |
{: caption="Automatically injected environment variables when deploying {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} jobs"}

Note that each job run instance gets its own index from the array of indices that were specified when the job was created. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically assigns indices starting from 0 to (array size - 1). The `JOB_INDEX` environment variable contains the index value.

While the job itself doesn't have a URL associated with it, the `CE_DOMAIN` and `CE_SUBDOMAIN` values might be useful if you need to reference an application that is running in the same project. The full external URL of this application is `appName.CE_SUBDOMAIN.CE_DOMAIN`. To reference the private URL of an application, use `appName.CE_SUBDOMAIN`.
