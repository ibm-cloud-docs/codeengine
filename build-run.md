# Running a build configuration
{: #build-run}

After you create a build configuration, you can submit a run based on that build configuration. Run your build from the console or with the CLI.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} has quotas for builds and build runs within a project. For more information about {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} limits, see [Limits and quotas for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-limits).
{: important}

Build runs that complete are automatically deleted. When your build run is based on build configuration, this build run is deleted after three hours if the build run is successful. If the build run is not successful, this build run is deleted after one week.
{: note}

## Running a build from the console
{: #build-run-console}

1. Go to the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview).
2. Select the project where you created your build.
3. From the project page, click **Image builds**.
4. From the **Image build** tab, select the name of the image build that you want to work with.
5. In the **Configuration** section, you can review the build configuration and change values, if needed.
6. Verify any additional information, such as the **Output image** for this build run, or overwrite the **Timeout** value.
7. Submit the build run by clicking **Submit build**.

Monitor your build progress in the **Build runs** section.

## Running a build with the CLI for source from a repository (non-local)
{: #build-run-cli}

To submit a build run from a build configuration with the CLI, use the **`buildrun submit`** command. This command requires the name of a build configuration. Other optional arguments can be specified. For a complete listing of options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce buildrun submit`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-buildrun-submit) command.
{: shortdesc}

The following example runs a build that is called `helloworld-build-run` and uses the `helloworld-build` build.

```txt
ibmcloud ce buildrun submit --build helloworld-build --name helloworld-build-run
```
{: pre}

Example output

```txt
Submitting build run 'helloworld-build-run'...
Run 'ibmcloud ce buildrun get -n helloworld-build-run' to check the build run status.
OK
```
{: screen}

The following table summarizes the options that are used with the **`buildrun submit`** command in this example. For more information about the command and its options, see the [`ibmcloud ce buildrun submit`](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-buildrun-submit) command.


| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--build` | The name of the build configuration to use. This value is required. |
| `--name` | The name of the build run. Use a name that is unique within the project. \n - The name must begin and end with a lowercase alphanumeric character. \n - The name must be 63 characters or fewer and can contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-). |

Your build runs begins. Monitor the progress by using the [**`ibmcloud ce buildrun get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-build-get) command.

For example, to check the status of the build run from the previous example,

```txt
ibmcloud ce buildrun get --name helloworld-build-run
```
{: pre}

Example output

```txt
Getting build run 'helloworld-build-run'...

## Running a build with the CLI for source from a local directory (local)
{: #build-run-cli-local}

To submit a build run from a build configuration with the CLI that pulls source from a local directory, use the **`buildrun submit`** command. This command requires the name of a build configuration, and the path to your local source. Other optional arguments can be specified. For a complete listing of options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce buildrun submit`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-buildrun-submit) command.
{: shortdesc}

The following scenario clones the [Samples for {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}} GitHub repo](https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine){: external} into a `CodeEngineLocalSample` directory on your local workstation.

1. Clone the [Samples for {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}} GitHub repo](https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine){: external} to a subdirectory that is created on your local workstation, such as the `CodeEngineLocalSamples` subdirectory. From this directory, run the `git clone` command; for example,

    ```txt
    git clone https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Go to the directory where your source code is on your workstation. For example, go to the `CodeEngine` subdirectory where the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Samples reside.

3. From the directory where your source code resides, submit the build run. The following example runs a build that is called `buildrun-local-dockerfile`and uses the `build-local-dockerfile` build configuration. The `--source` option specifies the path to the source on the local workstation to the `helloworld` sample.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce buildrun submit --name buildrun-local-dockerfile --build build-local-dockerfile --source ./helloworld
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Getting build 'build-local-dockerfile'
    Packaging files to upload from source path './helloworld' ...
    Submitting build run 'buildrun-local-dockerfile'...
    Run 'ibmcloud ce buildrun get -n buildrun-local-dockerfile' to check the build run status.
    OK
    ```
    {: screen}

4. Monitor the progress of your build run by using the [**`ibmcloud ce buildrun get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-build-get) command. For example, to check the status of the build run from the previous example,

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce buildrun get --name helloworld-build-run
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Getting build run 'buildrun-local-dockerfile'...
    Run 'C:\Program Files\IBM\Cloud\bin\ibmcloud.exe ce buildrun events -n buildrun-local-dockerfile' to get the system events of the build run.
    Run 'C:\Program Files\IBM\Cloud\bin\ibmcloud.exe ce buildrun logs -f -n buildrun-local-dockerfile' to follow the logs of the build run.
    OK

When you submit a build that pulls code from a local directory, your source code is packed into an archive file and uploaded to your {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} instance. After the build run is completed, you can see your built image, such as `codeengine-build`, in the {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} instance. You can also see a source image with `-source` appended to the name of your build, such as `codeengine-build-source`. You can delete this source image without impact.
