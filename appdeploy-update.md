# Updating your app
{: #update-app}

An application contains one or more *revisions*. A revision represents an immutable version of the configuration properties of the application. Each update of an application configuration property creates a new revision of the application.
{: shortdesc} 


When you modify an application and deploy the application with the changes, or [redeploy the application without changes to its configuration settings](#update-app-nochange), these actions deploy a new revision of the application. When you deploy (or redeploy) an application revision, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uses any changed configuration settings, and gets any updated container image, secret, or configmap that is referenced by the application. 

For more information about deploying applications, such as specifying [valid vCPU and memory combinations](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-mem-cpu-combo), defining commands and arguments, environment variables, secrets, or configmaps, see [Options for deploying an app](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#optionsdeploy).


{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} has a quota for the number of apps and app revisions in a project. For more information about limits for projects, see [Project quotas](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-limits#project_quotas). {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} retains only the latest inactive revision of your application in addition to your active app revision. Older revisions are deleted.
{: important}

You can [update your deployed app](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-update-app) and its referenced code by using *any* of the following ways, independent of how you created or previously updated your app:


- If you have a container image, per the [Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard](https://opencontainers.org/){: external}, then you need to provide only a reference to the image, which points to the location of your container registry when you deploy your app. You can deploy your app with an image in a [public registry](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app) or [private registry](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-private).


    If you created your app by using the **`app create`** command and you specified the `--build-source` option to build the container image from local or repository source, and you want to change your app to point to a different container image, you must first remove the association of the build from your app. For example, run `ibmcloud ce application update -n APP_NAME --build-clear`. After you remove the association of the build from your app, you can update the app to reference a different image. 
    {: important}

- If you are starting with source code that resides in a Git repository, you can choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} take care of building the image from your source and deploying the app with a **single** operation. In this scenario, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uploads your image to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}. To learn more, see [Deploying your app from repository source code](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code). If you want more control over the build of your image, then you can choose to [build the image](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build) with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} before you deploy your app. 

- If you are starting with source code that resides on a local workstation, you can choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} take care of building the image from your source and deploying the app with a **single** CLI command. In this scenario, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uploads your image to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}. To learn more, see [Deploying your app from local source code with the CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-local-source-code). If you want more control over the build of your image, then you can choose to [build the image](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build) with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} before you deploy your app. 

For example, you might choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} handle the build of your local source while you evolve the development of your source for the app. Then, after the image is matured, you can update the deployed app to reference the specific image that you want. You can repeat this process as needed.

When you deploy your updated app, the latest version of your referenced container image is downloaded and deployed, unless a tag is specified for the image. If a tag is specified for the image, then the tagged image is used for the deployment. 




## What if I want to redeploy my application without changing configuration settings? 
{: #update-app-nochange}

You can always deploy your application with configuration changes by changing a configuration value and deploying the application. 

However, you might want to redeploy an application revision without changing your application configuration settings. Perhaps your referenced container image is changed, and you want your application revision to use the updated container image. Or, perhaps you want your application to reference a secret or configmap, which contains updated content values. 

For these scenarios, from the console, you can click **Redeploy** from the **Configuration** tab of your application page, without changing your app configuration. With the CLI, use the [**`ibmcloud ce app update`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-update) command.

## Updating your app from the console
{: #update-app-console}

Update the application that you created in [Deploying an application from a public registry from the console](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app&interface=ui#deploy-app-console) to add an environment variable.

1. Navigate to your application page. One way to navigate to your application page is to 
    * Locate the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}. 
    * Click the name of your project to open the Overview page.
    * Click **Applications** to open a list of your applications. Click the name of your application to open its application page.
2. From the application page, you can view information about the running instances of your application and its revisions, configuration details, and endpoint settings of the app. Click the name of the application revision that you want to work with to open the configuration summary for that revision. Or, you can click the **Configuration** tab to open the configuration summary for the latest application revision. 
3. From the **Configuration** tab, click the **Environment variables** tab.
4. Click **Add environment variable**. Define this environment variable as a literal value. Enter `TARGET` for name and `Stranger` for value. Click **Add**.
5. Click **Deploy** to save your change and deploy the application revision.
6. After the application status changes to **Ready**, you can test the application revision. Click **Test application** and then click **Send request** in the Test application pane. To open the application in a web page, click **Application URL**. For this app, `Hello Stranger` is displayed.

In this example, you updated environment variables for an app. You can also update other configuration settings for your app, including referencing a [different image](#update-app-crimage-console) or [different image build](#update-app-source-console) from the **Code** tab. From the **Resources & scaling** tab, you can update [memory](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-mem-cpu-combo) and [application scaling](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-scale) settings for your app. From the **Environment variables** tab, you can add or update [environment variables](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-envvar) for your app. From the **Image start options** tab, you can add or update [command and arguments](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cmd-args) to override settings within your container image, or [work with liveness and readiness probes](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-probes). 

## Updating your app to use project-only endpoints from the console
{: #update-app-console-projendpt}

By default, when you deploy an app, the app deploys such that it can receive requests from the public internet, from a private network, or from components within the project. Let's change the visibility of this app such that it is accessed only by other {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} resources that are running in the same {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} environment. Use the **Domain mappings** tab to change the visibility of an app. 

1. Navigate to your application page. One way to navigate to your application page is to 
    * Locate the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}. 
    * Click the name of your project to open the Overview page.
    * Click **Applications** to open a list of your applications. Click the name of your application to open its application page.
2. From the application page, you can view information about the running instances of your application and its revisions, configuration details, and endpoint settings of the app. Click the **Domain mappings** tab to open the endpoint visibility settings for the application.  
3. From the **Domain mappings** tab, notice the available URLs for your application. When `Public` is selected, you can view the public and the internal system domain mapping URL for the application. When **No external system domain mapping** is selected, this application is no longer accessible from the public internet and network access is only possible from components within this project. 

    When you change the visibility of your app, the change is effective immediately. It is important to consider the impact of the change for your active users or integrations as well as any security implications. You can change the visibility setting as needed.

## Updating your app to use private endpoints from the console
{: #update-app-console-privateendpt}

By default, when you deploy an app, the app deploys such that it can receive requests from the public internet, from a private network, or from components within the project. Let's change the visibility of this app such that it is accessed only by other {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} resources that are running in the same project and from the private network by using Virtual Private Endpoints. Use the **Domain mappings** tab to change the visibility of an app. 

1. Navigate to your application page. One way to navigate to your application page is to 
    * Locate the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}. 
    * Click the name of your project to open the Overview page.
    * Click **Applications** to open a list of your applications. Click the name of your application to open its application page.
2. From the application page, you can view information about the running instances of your application and its revisions, configuration details, and endpoint settings of the app. Click the **Domain mappings** tab to open the endpoint visibility settings for the application.  
3. From the **Domain mappings** tab, notice the available URLs for your application. When `Private` is selected, this application is no longer accessible from the public internet and network access is only possible from components within this project (cluster-local) and from the private network.

    Click **Private** to change the endpoint visibility of the app. The available URLs for your endpoint definition are displayed for the private and project-only URLs.

4. To access your app securely by using a Virtual Private Endpoint (VPE), follow the instructions for [Using your VPE to access an app](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-vpe#using-vpes-app) to set up the VPE to access your app. 

If you set your application for `visibility = private`, then you can only test your application through the [virtual private endpoint from within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-vpe).

By changing the visibility of your app, the change is effective immediately. It is important to consider the impact of the change for your active users or integrations as well as any security implications. You can change the visibility setting as needed.

## Updating your app with the CLI
{: #update-app-cli}

To update your app with the CLI, use the **`app update`** command. This command requires the name of the app that you want to update and also allows other optional arguments. For a complete listing of options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce app update`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-update) command.
{: shortdesc}

Update the application that you created in [Deploying an application with the CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app&interface=cli#deploy-app-cli) to add an environment variable. 

The sample `icr.io/codeengine/hello` image reads the environment variable `TARGET`, and prints `Hello ${TARGET}`. If this environment variable is empty, `Hello World` is returned. The following example updates the app to modify the value of the `TARGET` environment variable to `Stranger`. For more information about the code that is used for this example, see [`hello`](https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine/tree/main/hello){: external}.

1. Run the **`application update`** command. For example,

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce application update -n myapp --env TARGET=Stranger
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Updating application 'myapp' to latest revision.
    [...]
    Run 'ibmcloud ce application get -n myapp' to check the application status.
    OK

    https://myapp.4svg40kna19.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud    
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Run the **`application get`** command to display the status of your app, including the latest revision information. 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce application get --name myapp  
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt

    From the output in the **Revisions** section, you can see the latest application revision of the `myapp` service. Also, notice that 100% of the traffic to the application is running the latest revision of the app. 

3. Call the application. 

    ```txt
    curl https://myapp.4svg40kna19.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt

    {: screen}

You can manage your app revisions by using the [**`ibmcloud ce revision get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-revision-get) command to display details of an app revision and the [**`ibmcloud ce revision delete`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-revision-delete) command to remove revisions that you don't want to keep. You can also use the  [**`ibmcloud ce revision logs`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-revision-logs) command to view logs of application revision instances. Use the [**`ibmcloud ce revision events`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-revision-events) command to display system events of application revision instances.

## Updating your app to use project-only endpoints with the CLI
{: #update-app-cli-projectonly}

By default, when you deploy an app, the app deploys such that it can receive requests from the public internet, from a private network, or from components within the project. To change the visibility of your app such that it is accessed only by other {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} resources that are running in the same project, use the `--visibility=project` option with the [**`ibmcloud ce app update`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-update) or [**`ibmcloud ce app create`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-create) command.{: shortdesc}

In this scenario, update the application that you created in [Deploying an application with the CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app&interface=cli#deploy-app-cli) to change the visibility of the app to use a [project endpoint](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#app-endpoint-projectonly).  

1. Run the **`application update`** command. For example,

    From the output in the **Revisions** section, you can see the latest application revision of the `myapp` service. Also, notice that 100% of the traffic to the application is running the latest revision of the app. 

Now that you set `--visibility=project` on your application, this application is no longer accessible from the public internet and network access is only possible from components within this project (cluster-local).

## Updating your app to use private endpoints with the CLI
{: #update-app-cli-privateendpt}

By default, when you deploy an app, the app deploys such that it can receive requests from the public internet, from a private network, or from components within the project. You can set the endpoint visibility for your app such that it is deployed with a private endpoint. Setting a private endpoint means that your app is not accessible from the public internet and network access is only possible from other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services from virtual private endpoints (VPC) or {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} components that are running in the same project (cluster-local).
{: shortdesc}

 To change the visibility of your app such that it is accessed only with a private endpoint, use the `--visibility=private` option with the [**`ibmcloud ce app update`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-update) or [**`ibmcloud ce app create`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-create) command.{: shortdesc}

 You can only use your VPE to access your app with a private endpoint if your selected project supports [application private visibility](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#app-endpoint-private). To confirm if the project supports application private visibility, use the  [**`ibmcloud ce project get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-get) command to verify the output for `Application Private Visibility Supported` is set to `true`. 
{: important}

In this scenario, update the application that you created in [Deploying an application with the CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app&interface=cli#deploy-app-cli) to change the visibility of the app to use a [private endpoint](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#app-endpoint-private). 


1. Confirm that the existing project supports applications with private visibility. Use the  [**`ibmcloud ce project get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-project-get) command to verify the output for `Application Private Visibility Supported` is set to `true`. If the value is `false`, [contact IBM support](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-get-support) to enable this capability within your existing project.

2. If `Application Private Visibility Supported` is `true`, then you can update your app to use private endpoints. Run the **`application update`** command. For example,

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce application update -n myapp --visibility=private
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Updating application 'myapp' to latest revision.
    [...]
    Run 'ibmcloud ce application get -n myapp' to check the application status.
    OK

    https://myapp.4svg40kna19.private.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Run the **`application get`** command to display the status of your app, including the latest revision information. 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce application get --name myapp

## Updating an app to reference a different image
{: #update-app-diff-image}

You can update your app to reference a different image.

The image that is associated with your specific application revision has a unique container registry digest, and {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uses this digest for the life of your application revision. If you create a newer version of an image with the same tag as the original image, the original image is overwritten in the container registry and becomes untagged. The newer image is tagged, and this newer image has a different digest. Your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} application does not use this newer image, because the newer image has a different digest than the  image that is referenced by the application revision. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} can still create new instances of the application revision as long as the untagged image, which was referenced originally, still exists. For more information, see [Why can't {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} pull an image?](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-image-cannot-pull)
{: important}

### Updating an app to reference a different image in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} from the console
{: #update-app-crimage-console}

Update an application to reference a different image in a container registry by using the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} console.
{: shortdesc}

For this example, let's update the `helloapp` that you created in [Deploying an application that references an image in a container registry from the console](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-crimage#deploy-app-crimage-console) to reference a different image. The updated app references the `helloworld_repo` image in the `mynamespace2` namespace in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}}. The following steps describe adding access to a registry during the update of an app. 

For more information about adding an image to {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}}, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-started#getting-started).

1. Navigate to your application page. One way to navigate to your application page is to 
    * Locate the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}. 
    * Click the name of your project to open the Overview page.
    * Click **Applications** to open a list of your applications. Click the name of your application to open the application page.
2. Click the **Configuration** tab to open the configuration details for the latest application revision. 
3. From the **Configuration** tab, click the **Code** tab.
4. For Image to run, click **Configure image** to open the configure image dialog. For this example, update the app to reference an existing `ibmcregistry` registry, select the `mynamespace2` namespace, select the `helloworld-repo` image, and select `1` as the value for `tag`. From the configure image page,
    * If the image you want to use resides in the same {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}} account, select the access for the registry.
    * If the image that you want to use resides in a different container registry account, you can select the registry access for this registry. If the registry access does not exist, you must first [create your IAM API key](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-add-registry#images-your-account-api-key) and then [Add registry access to {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-add-registry#add-registry-access-ce). 

    If you want to update only the registry access to your image, you can make this change without clicking **Configure image** to open the configure image dialog and use the Registry access menu to select an existing registry access or [create a registry access to {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-add-registry#add-registry-access-ce) for the image that is referenced by your application.   
    {: note}
    
5. Click **Done**. You selected your image in the registry to reference from your app.
6. Click **Deploy** to save your change and deploy the app revision.
7. After the application status changes to **Ready**, you can test the app revision. Click **Test application** and then click **Send request** in the Test application pane. To open the application in a web page, click **Application URL**. For this app, `Hello World from {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}` is displayed.

### Updating an app to reference a different image in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} with the CLI
{: #update-app-crimage-cli}

Update an application to reference a different image in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} from the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI.
{: shortdesc}

For this example, update the `myhelloapp` that you created in [Deploying an application that references an image in a container registry with the CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-crimage#deploy-app-crimage-cli) to reference a different image in a different namespace in the same account. Update the app to reference the `helloworld_repo` image in the `mynamespace2` namespace in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}}. 

1. Add a different image to {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}}. For this example, add the `helloworld_repo` image in the `mynamespace2` namespace in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}}. For more information about adding an image to {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}}, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-started#getting-started).

2. Add registry access to {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}. For this example, because the `helloworld_repo` image resides in the same account, use the previously defined `myregistry` registry access. 

3. Update your app and reference the image in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} by using the `myregistry` access. For example, update the `myhelloapp` app to reference the `us.icr.io/mynamespace2/helloworld_repo` by using the `myregistry` access information. 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce app update --name myhelloapp --image us.icr.io/mynamespace2/helloworld_repo:1 --registry-secret myregistry
    ```
    {: pre}

    The format of the name of the image for this application is `REGISTRY/NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY:TAG` where `REGISTRY` and `TAG` are optional. If `REGISTRY` is not specified, the default is `docker.io`. If `TAG` is not specified, the default is `latest`.
    {: important}

4. After your app is updated, you can access the app. To obtain the URL of your app, run `ibmcloud ce app get --name myhelloapp --output url`. When you curl the `myhelloapp` app, the app returns `Hello World from {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}`, which demonstrates the app is now using the `helloworld_repo` image. 

### Updating an app to reference an image that is built from source code from the console
{: #update-app-source-console}

Update an application to reference an image that is built from source code by using the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} console.
{: shortdesc}

For this example, let's update the `helloapp` that you created in [Deploying an application that references an image in a container registry from the console](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-crimage#deploy-app-crimage-console) to reference an image that is built from your source code. 

For more information about creating a build configuration from the console, see [create a build](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-build-create-config1).

1. Navigate to your application page. One way to navigate to your application page is to 
    * Locate the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Projects page](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects){: external}. 
    * Click the name of your project to open the Overview page.
    * Click **Applications** to open a list of your applications. Click the name of your application to open the application page.
2. Click the **Configuration** tab to open the configuration details for the latest application revision. 
3. From the **Configuration** tab, click the **Code** tab. 
4. From the **Code** tab, you can create an image build, or you can rerun an existing image build that is referenced by your application. To create an image build, click **Create image from source** to run an image build. The Specify build details page opens where you can enter the details of your build to [deploy your app from source code](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code). Click **Done** when build detail updates are specified. 
5. Click **Deploy** to save your changes, run the build, and deploy the app revision.
6. After the application status changes to **Ready**, you can test the app revision. Click **Test application** and then click **Send request** in the Test application pane. To open the application in a web page, click **Application URL**. 
7. To update this application again to reference an updated build image, click **Rerun build** from the **Code** tab, and specify a unique image tag for the updated build image. If you want to make more changes to the build details, click **Edit build details**. The Specify build details page opens where you can enter the details of your build to [deploy your app from source code](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code). Click **Done** when build detail updates are specified. 
8. Click **Deploy** to save your changes, run the build with your changes, and deploy the app revision.
9. After the application status changes to **Ready**, you can test the app revision. Click **Test application** and then click **Send request** in the Test application pane. To open the application in a web page, click **Application URL**.

### Updating an app to reference an image that is built from source code with the CLI
{: #update-app-source-cli}

Update an application to reference an image that is built from source code by using the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI.
{: shortdesc}

For this example, let's change the `myhelloapp` that you updated in [Updating an app to reference a different image in Container Registry with the CLI](#update-app-crimage-cli) to reference a different image that is built from your source code. 

From the previous example, the `myhelloapp` app references the `us.icr.io/mynamespace2/helloworld_repo` by using the `myregistry` access information. Let's create a build configuration, run the build, and update the `myhelloapp` to reference the image that was built from source code. 

1.  Create the build configuration. For example, the following **`build create`** command creates a build configuration that is called `helloworld-build`. This configuration builds from the public Git repo `https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine`, uses the `dockerfile` strategy and `medium` build size, and stores the image to `us.icr.io/mynamespace/codeengine-helloworld` by using the image registry secret that is defined in `myregistry`.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce build create --name helloworld-build --image us.icr.io/mynamespace/codeengine-helloworld --registry-secret myregistry --source https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine --commit main --context-dir /hello --strategy dockerfile --size medium
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Run the build. This example runs a build that is called `helloworld-build-run` and uses the `helloworld-build` build configuration. 

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce buildrun submit --build helloworld-build --name helloworld-build-run 
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following output displays the details of the build run by using the  [**`ibmcloud ce buildrun get`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-buildrun-get) command.

    Example output

    ```txt
    Getting build run 'helloworld-build-run'...
    [...]
    OK

    {: screen}

    For more information about creating a build configuration with the CLI, see [create a build](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-build-create-config1#build-create-cli).

3. Update the `myhelloapp` to reference the image that you built and uses the `myregistry` registry secret.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce app update --name myhelloapp --image us.icr.io/mynamespace/codeengine-helloworld --registry-secret myregistry
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Display information about the updated app to confirm the image that is referenced is the image that you built.
