# Deploying your app from local source code with the CLI
{: #app-local-source-code}

You can deploy your application directly from source code on your local workstation with the {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} CLI. Use the **`app create`** command to both build an image from your local source, and deploy your application to reference this built image.
{: shortdesc}

When you submit a build that pulls code from a local directory, your source code is packed into an archive file. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically uploads the image to an {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}} namespace in your account, and then creates and deploys your app to reference this built image. Note that you can only target {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} for your local builds. The source image is created in the same namespace as your build image. For this scenario, you need to provide only a name for the app and the path to the local source. For a complete listing of options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce app create`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-create) command.  

For information about required permissions for accessing image registries, see [Setting up authorities for image registries](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-add-registry#authorities-registry).

You can choose to ignore certain file patterns from within your source code by using the `.ceignore` file, which behaves similarly to a `.gitignore` file. For example, entries for a `.ceignore` file for a node.js application might include `node_modules` and `.npm`. For more sample file patterns to ignore, see the [GitHub .gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore){: external}.


The {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}} is required for this scenario.
{: important}

Before you begin

* Set up your [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-install-cli) environment.
* [Create and work with a project](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project).

Before you work with local source, make sure that your source is in an accessible location on your local workstation.  

This example uses the `https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine` samples; in particular, the `helloworld` sample. 

1. Download the `https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine` sample source to your local workstation with the following command.

    ```txt
    git clone https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Change to the `CodeEngine\helloworld` directory. 

3. From the `CodeEngine\helloworld` directory, create and deploy the `myapp-local` app, which uses an image that is built from the `CodeEngine\helloworld` source on your local workstation. This command automatically builds and pushes the image to a {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} namespace in your account. If you do not have an existing {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} namespace, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically creates one for you.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce application create --name myapp-local --build-source .
    ```
    {: pre}

    The `.` indicates the build source is located in your current working directory. 
    {: note}


    Example output

    ```txt
    Creating application 'myapp-local'...
    Packaging files to upload from source path '.'...
    Submitting build run 'myapp-local-run-220414-171750199'...

    ```
    {: screen}

    Notice the output of the **`application create`** command provides information on the progression of the build run before the app is created and deployed. 
    {: tip}

    In this example, the built image is uploaded to the `ce--abcde-glxo4kabcde` namespace in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}. 

    The following table summarizes the options that are used with the **`app create`** command in this example. For more information about the command and its options, see the [**`ibmcloud ce app create`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-create) command.

    | Option | Description |
    | -------------- | -------------- |
    | `--name` | The name of the application. Use a name that is unique within the project. This value is required. \n - The name must begin with a lowercase letter. \n - The name must end with a lowercase alphanumeric character. \n - The name must be 63 characters or fewer and can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens (-). | 
    | `--build-source` | The path to the local source. |

4. Use the **`application get`** command to display information about your app, including information about the build.

    ```txt
    ibmcloud ce application get --name myapp-local
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

Now that your app is created and deployed from local source code, you can update the app to meet your needs by using the [**`ibmcloud ce app update`**](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli#cli-application-update) command. For more information about updating apps, see [Updating your app](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-update-app). If you want to update your source to use with your app, you must provide the `--build-source` option on the **`application update`** command.

Instead of building your image from local source and deploying your app with a single command, you can choose to build from local source first *before* you deploy your app. See [Creating a build configuration that pulls source from a local workstation](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-build-config-local). 

When your app is deployed from local source or from [repository source code](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code) from the CLI, the resulting build run is not based on a build configuration. Build runs that complete are ultimately automatically deleted.  Build runs that are not based on a build configuration are deleted after 1 hour if the build run is successful. If the build run is not successful, this build run is deleted after 24 hours. You can only display information about this build run with the CLI. You cannot view this build run in the console.

## Next steps
{: #nextsteps-app-localdeploysource}

* After your app deploys, [access your app](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-access-service) through a URL.

* You can create a [custom domain mapping](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-domain-mappings) and assign it to your app. For more information about deploying apps across multiple regions with a custom domain name, see [Configuring a highly available application](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-multiple-regions). 

* Now that your app is deployed, consider making your apps event-driven. By using event subscriptions, you can trigger your apps by [periodic schedules](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-subscribe-cron#eventing-cron-existing-app) or set your app to react to events such as [file uploads](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-eventing-cosevent-producer#obstorage_ev_app) or [Kafka messages](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-working-kafkaevent-producer).

After your app is deployed, you can [update your deployed app](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-update-app) and its referenced code by using *any* of the following ways, independent of how you created or previously updated your app:

- If you have a container image, per the [Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard](https://opencontainers.org/){: external}, then you need to provide only a reference to the image, which points to the location of your container registry when you deploy your app. You can deploy your app with an image in a [public registry](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app) or [private registry](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-private).

    If you created your app by using the **`app create`** command and you specified the `--build-source` option to build the container image from local or repository source, and you want to change your app to point to a different container image, you must first remove the association of the build from your app. For example, run `ibmcloud ce application update -n APP_NAME --build-clear`. After you remove the association of the build from your app, you can update the app to reference a different image. 
    {: important}

- If you are starting with source code that resides in a Git repository, you can choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} take care of building the image from your source and deploying the app with a **single** operation. In this scenario, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uploads your image to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}. To learn more, see [Deploying your app from repository source code](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code). If you want more control over the build of your image, then you can choose to [build the image](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build) with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} before you deploy your app. 

- If you are starting with source code that resides on a local workstation, you can choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} take care of building the image from your source and deploying the app with a **single** CLI command. In this scenario, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uploads your image to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}. To learn more, see [Deploying your app from local source code with the CLI](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-local-source-code). If you want more control over the build of your image, then you can choose to [build the image](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build) with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} before you deploy your app. 

    For example, you might choose to let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} handle the build of your local source while you evolve the development of your source for the app. Then, after the image is matured, you can update the deployed app to reference the specific image that you want. You can repeat this process as needed.

When you deploy your updated app, the latest version of your referenced container image is downloaded and deployed, unless a tag is specified for the image. If a tag is specified for the image, then the tagged image is used for the deployment.
